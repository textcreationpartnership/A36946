            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Reader</hi> will here find <hi>TWO Choice Manuals</hi> Drawn into <hi>ONE;</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>Walſingham</hi>'s <hi>Arcana Aulica,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Naunton</hi>'s <hi>Fragmenta Regalia:</hi> The <hi>Former</hi> a <hi>Compendium</hi> of <hi>Politicks</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98923:4"/>for the Ordering of a <hi>Court-Life;</hi> The <hi>Other,</hi> a Judicious Collection of <hi>Great Examples,</hi> that have Acted in Conformity to Thoſe <hi>Precepts,</hi> and made themſelves Famous to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity in their Reſpective Stations. <hi>Theſe Two Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> have already, and long ſince, been made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in <hi>Three Impreſſions</hi> Each, and in Several Forms; to the Univerſal Satisfaction of All Men of State and Buſineſs. So that I might leave this
<pb facs="tcp:98923:4"/>BOOK to ſpeak for it ſelf, without an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, upon the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Own Worth, and Merit, if it were not that betwixt the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Lazyneſs of This Laſt Age, wherein Men have attended their Pleaſures, and their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, more than their Duty; not onely <hi>Theſe Papers Themſelves,</hi> but the very <hi>Subject</hi> of them has, for ſome time, lain Neglected and Forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: But being now
<pb facs="tcp:98923:5"/>fall'n into a World of a more <hi>Active, Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Humour,</hi> when, in truth, Every <hi>Plough-Jobber</hi> ſets up for a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician,</hi> and the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> are become the <hi>Common Topick</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> I reckon'd that I could not do my Countrymen a Better Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or make them a more Acceptable Preſent, than in the Revival of Theſe Two Copies, which are in Effect but One Epitome of what is fit to
<pb facs="tcp:98923:5"/>be Known, and fit to be Done upon the Matter in Queſtion; the One ſerving onely for a Rule, or a Leſſon to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Now as to <hi>Walſingham</hi>'s <hi>Arcana,</hi> the <hi>READER</hi> is to take This along with him, That it is a Tract of <hi>Policy,</hi> not of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> and as well Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, what Courtiers are <hi>Not</hi> to do, as what they <hi>Are.</hi> It ſets forth the True Reaſons, Methods,
<pb facs="tcp:98923:6"/>Riſe, Progreſs, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Things, in ſuch a way, as ſerves both for Direction, in order to the Attaining of Honeſt and Honourable Ends, and for Precaution, toward the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of Snares and Temptations, and Detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Impoſtures that Occur in a Court-Life. And to ſhew the <hi>Reader,</hi> that Theſe Reſearches of his have ſomewhat more in them than the Vain I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of Speculation and Fancy, he Backs all his
<pb facs="tcp:98923:6"/>Diſcourſes and Opinions with the moſt Pertinent and Venerable Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that Hiſtory could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him, either upon Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, or Experience. By the Benefit of This Mixture, he Joyns Profit with Delight; Firſt, by ſetting the Underſtanding Right in all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Queſtion; and then by Engaging the Will, and Inclination, to an Aſſent to That Rule. To ſpeak all in One Word; the Whole Tract is but ſo
<pb facs="tcp:98923:7"/>many <hi>Political Maxims</hi> Orderly Digeſted under ſo many Articles or Heads in the Nature of an <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> for the Common Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of All thoſe that propound the making of their Fortunes by a Court-Application.</p>
            <p>Here is enough ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to Juſtifie the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of This Little BOOK, with a Reſpect to the Time, the Place, the People, the Argument, and the Preſent Occaſion; for
<pb facs="tcp:98923:7"/>it ſeems to be a very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, a Seaſonable, and an Uſeful Work to All Theſe Intents: Not but that I have had Other Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon me of Civility, and Good Manners, as well as of Diſcretion in Submiſſion to ſeveral Powerful Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Men of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Vertue, and Good Letters, for the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it to the Preſs. And I have dealt ſo Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon the Whole Matter too, that it comes
<pb facs="tcp:98923:8"/>into the World now juſt as I Found it, without Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Adding, or Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, ſo much as one Single Syllable: referring the <hi>Reader</hi> to the <hi>Author</hi> himſelf to Expound his Own Meaning upon any <hi>Ideas</hi> he may have had of Perſons and Caſes.</p>
            <p>As for Sir <hi>Robert Naun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s <hi>Fragments,</hi> I ſhall need ſay no more of them, to the Reputation they have had in the World, than that they
<pb facs="tcp:98923:8"/>have been Highly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd, as an <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Collection</hi> of <hi>Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Remarks,</hi> by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Men of Place and Buſineſs: Inſomuch, that ſince the <hi>BOOK</hi> was out of Print, it has been the Conſtant Work of Divers Clerks in <hi>PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAMENT,</hi> and <hi>Term-time,</hi> to Tranſcribe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of it for the Uſe and Service of the Lovers of <hi>ANTIQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ITIES,</hi> and <hi>State-HISTORY;</hi> And Theſe COPIES had the

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Laſt</hi> of which ways, is without doubt the <hi>ſhorteſt,</hi> and traced with their <hi>ſteps,</hi> who have lived in the <hi>greateſt Favour</hi> with their <hi>Princes;</hi> as <hi>Mecaenas</hi> was to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Salluſt</hi> both to him, and his Succeſſor <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> of whom <hi>Tacitus,</hi> Annal. 3.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe ways of <hi>becoming Known</hi> and <hi>Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to the <hi>Prince,</hi> are various, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Diverſity</hi> of the <hi>Courtiers,</hi> and the <hi>Times;</hi> there are ſome that make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>known</hi> by their <hi>Actions ſignally,</hi> either <hi>Profitable,</hi> or <hi>Glorious;</hi> or elſe by a <hi>more</hi> than Common <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Honeſty.</hi> The <hi>Commendation of others</hi> gives to many, both Acceſs to, and Intereſt in the <hi>Prince,</hi> which is indeed the moſt uſual way of all. For <hi>Princes</hi> live in ſuch a degree of eminence <hi>above others,</hi> and are ſo <hi>Hedged in</hi> with the number of <hi>Peers</hi> and train
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98923:16"/>of <hi>Veterane Courtiers,</hi> that a <hi>Stranger</hi> can hardly thruſt in amongſt the throng that ſtand in his way, unleſs either there be <hi>ſome one</hi> to take him by the hand, and make his paſſage, or elſe that himſelf, by ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary enterprize do <hi>attract the Eyes</hi> of all men upon him, and, amongſt others, thoſe of the <hi>Prince.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here the Fact of the Architect <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrates,</hi> or as ſome call him <hi>Staſicrates,</hi> is very memorable. He deſiring to become known unto the <hi>Great Alexander,</hi> when all the <hi>Courtiers</hi> had refuſed to bring him to the King, bethinks of a way of preſenting himſelf all naked, anointed with Oyl, a pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Crown on his head, upon his left ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Lyon's Skin, and holding a great Club in his Right hand: And thus Accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, he comes into <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <hi>Preſence,</hi> as he was ſitting on his <hi>Throne.</hi> The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the thing drew the Eyes of all upon him, and moved <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf ſo far, as he cauſed the Man to be brought unto him; and though he approved not of what he propounded, yet he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he ſhould be Enrolled amongſt his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not bring this Example to perſwade any body with the <hi>like Foolery,</hi> to inſinuate himſelf into the <hi>Prince's</hi> Favour, but to the end I may demonſtrate, That thoſe who are <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>unknown,</hi> unleſs they be aſſiſted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98923:16"/>by ſome <hi>one in great Authority,</hi> can hardly <hi>Scrue</hi> themſelves into ſo great a train, as do Surround the <hi>Prince,</hi> except either by ſome <hi>memorable Action,</hi> as we have ſaid before, or by ſome <hi>unuſual Accident,</hi> they deſerve, as the <hi>Poet</hi> ſays,

                  <p>OUr <hi>Young Courtier,</hi> who deſires to be <hi>Known</hi> and <hi>Loved</hi> by the <hi>Prince,</hi> muſt obſerve well the <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Conditions,</hi> not onely of the <hi>Prince himſelf,</hi> but alſo of ſuch of his <hi>Followers,</hi> as he moſt <hi>Truſts</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon; together with the <hi>Peers,</hi> and all others who may either afford him any <hi>Help</hi> or <hi>Countenance;</hi> or elſe on the contrary (ſtirred up either with <hi>Emulation, Fear, Envy, Hate,</hi> their <hi>own,</hi> or their <hi>Friends concernments</hi>) work him any prejudice. It is chiefly neceſſary that he make a full diſcovery of the <hi>Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> that for the moſt part follow the temperature of his body;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98923:17"/>which though by <hi>wary Princes,</hi> they be much Concealed and Smothered, yet it ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but that ſometimes they <hi>break out,</hi> and as it were laying aſide <hi>diſguiſes,</hi> ſhow themſelves. Since all their Actions are ſo expoſed to the eyes of Men, it cannot be, but <hi>Some one</hi> or <hi>other,</hi> muſt obſerve where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto their <hi>Inclinations</hi> tend. Sometimes they are ſo <hi>Oppreſt</hi> and <hi>Vext</hi> with the <hi>weight of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,</hi> that forgetting their <hi>Artifices,</hi> they <hi>betray</hi> their diſpoſitions; <hi>Tiberius</hi> himſelf, although a moſt skilful <hi>Maſter in Diſſembling,</hi> could not ſet ſo good a face upon it, but that Time would by little and little, bring all his <hi>Arts to light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſince <hi>Thoſe</hi> of other Men are ſo many, the <hi>Propenſions of Princes</hi> muſt needs be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and almoſt Infinite; yet they may be reduced to <hi>two Heads.</hi> The one of which, includes all that tends to the <hi>Greatneſs of his State;</hi> The other his <hi>Perſonal Pleaſures;</hi> His <hi>Greatneſs</hi> conſiſts either in his <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> or in <hi>Riches;</hi> the duty of his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> or laſtly, in the Strength and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his <hi>Armies.</hi> In theſe things he ought to accommodate his <hi>Endeavours</hi> to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>Princes</hi> affairs; which he that ſhall with Dexterity and Skill perform, provided he be neither ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nor hated for <hi>other Reaſons,</hi> cannot fail of becoming Acceptable unto the <hi>Prince.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Let us ſee an example or two of this Corruption. <hi>Feſtinus</hi> the friend of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> during <hi>Valentinians</hi>'s Reign, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Aſia</hi> with a wonderful repute of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs</hi> and <hi>Modeſty;</hi> being a ſharp reprover of the Violence and Cruelties of <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and of the <hi>Calumnies</hi> and <hi>Frauds,</hi> wherewith he circumvented many: But at laſt obſerving that his <hi>Companion</hi> by theſe means had gotten the command of the <hi>Praetorian Bands,</hi> next in dignity to the <hi>Emperour</hi> himſelf, he changed his manner of life, and imitating <hi>Maximinus,</hi> did many <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>cruel things.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtides</hi> the <hi>firſt,</hi> both in name and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being by the <hi>Athenians</hi> made <hi>Treaſurer;</hi> In the firſt place, according to his own <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> and the duty of an <hi>Honeſt man,</hi> went about to hinder all thoſe that were under his <hi>charge,</hi> from robbing the <hi>Treaſury;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they preſently accuſed him of <hi>Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Bribery,</hi> as one of the corrupteſt perſons that ever bore that office; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that he had like to have been <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:</hi> But being at laſt <hi>quit,</hi> and his <hi>office</hi> ſtill continued, he determined to <hi>imitate</hi> his <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> and wink at the thefts of his <hi>Companions;</hi> by which means, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reobtained the name of a <hi>Good man,</hi> in the opinion of all.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome one will ſay, that it ſeldom falls out, that a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> or a diſſolute <hi>Prince,</hi> will take into his Favour an <hi>Honest Man;</hi> I do not deny but it is very rare, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98923:21"/>yet I muſt affirm there are few <hi>Princes Courts,</hi> in which there are not ſome <hi>good men</hi> found; if not call'd thither by the <hi>Prince,</hi> at leaſt drawn thither by their own deſire of <hi>doing good</hi> to others, and infringing the power of <hi>evil men:</hi> Who ſtand their ground there to that end, through the aſſiſtance of the beſt diſpoſed <hi>Courtiers,</hi> and through the friendſhip and patronage of ſome Great man, obſerving carefully there, that wholeſome rule of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus,</hi> whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> (Annal. 4.) brings for an example of a Good and wiſe <hi>Courtier,</hi> who neither with an unſeaſonable Contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy did exaſperate the <hi>Prince,</hi> nor with a <hi>ſordid flattery</hi> Sooth him in his vices. The ſame <hi>Tacitus</hi> for theſe reaſons commends <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pito</hi> and <hi>Labeo. That age</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>had at once two Ornaments of peace; But</hi> Labeo <hi>was of a more incorrupted liberty, and therefore more eſteemed, whileſt</hi> Capito's <hi>pleaſing humour was more acceptable to the great ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not deny, but a <hi>Courtier's</hi> life will be far more difficult to an honeſt man than to another; But withal I muſt affirm, that the advantage of <hi>Glory</hi> and content of <hi>Mind,</hi> that will ariſe from thence, will much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the trouble of it. Since that, if he carry himſelf wiſely, and accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thoſe things that he ſees, he cannot change nor overcome; I dare ſay, he will at laſt become acceptable to the worſt of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98923:21"/>
                     <hi>Princes,</hi> and dearer than others that are of a worſe repute; who ſeldom manage the <hi>Prince's</hi> buſineſs with a due fidelity and care; or at leaſt not equal to that he might eaſily promiſe to himſelf from the hands of a vertuous and honeſt man. And hither tends the Counſel of <hi>Salluſt</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caenas,</hi> whereby the firſt recommended to <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and the latter to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the choice and friendſhip of <hi>Good men.</hi> Becauſe Conſcience and care of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation reſtrains theſe more powerfully from diſhoneſt things, than the <hi>fear</hi> of puniſhment, or the <hi>want of</hi> Power doth others.</p>
                  <p>But as I have ſaid, the vicious are always in <hi>Court</hi> in greater throngs; who chiefly by two ways do Ingratiate themſelves with the <hi>Prince;</hi> firſt by Flattering and Fulfilling whatever he ſhall pleaſe to command; and that by ſo much the more ſervilely, by how much the more their hopes of gain are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Next for that <hi>Princes</hi> are pleaſed to have thoſe about them, in compariſon of whom, themſelves, though <hi>bad</hi> God knows, ſeem to be <hi>good.</hi> Some there are that think al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their lives more ſecure in the company of thoſe that are moſt like unto themſelves. <hi>Dionyſias</hi> the Tyrant, being requeſted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel out of his <hi>Court</hi> one, who for his villainy was hated by all men, anſwered, <hi>No, he would keep him, leſt otherwiſe he himſelf ſhould
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98923:22"/>become the moſt hateful perſon in the Court.</hi> It is natural to thoſe who find themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to any <hi>vice,</hi> by comparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to thoſe that are worſe, to ſeek to purchaſe to themſelves ſome ſhew of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity;</hi> And it hath been an <hi>Old</hi> trick of <hi>Princes,</hi> on purpoſe to chooſe unlikely <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,</hi> to the end their own acts and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues might appear better and more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: For <hi>Tacitus</hi> is of opinion, that for no other reaſon did <hi>Auguſtus</hi> adopt <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whoſe arrogance and cruelty he knew full well; nor <hi>Tiberius</hi> chooſe <hi>Caligula.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is principally neceſſary, that a good man be very Sober and Circumſpect in his diſcourſe; for <hi>Princes</hi> ſeldom or never love an <hi>unwary</hi> and <hi>careleſs</hi> liberty in any kind of men, how vertuous ſoever they be. Neither did <hi>Plato</hi>'s freedom with <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius</hi> ſucceed well, for therefore was he delivered up to a needy Mariner, and ſent to be ſold in the Iſle of <hi>Creet;</hi> whence being redeemed by certain Philoſophers, he was admoniſhed <hi>either to abſtain wholly from the converſation of Princes, or to ſpeak plauſible things:</hi> With the like advices did <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> furniſh his Cozen <hi>Calliſthenes,</hi> then going to attend upon <hi>Alexander,</hi> to wit, <hi>That he ſhould very ſeldom ſpeak, and then never but pleaſing things, to him upon whoſe Tongues-end lay the diſpoſal of his life.</hi>

                  <p>That Flattery is very notable of <hi>Valerius Meſſalla,</hi> recorded by <hi>Tacitus</hi> Annal. 1.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98923:24"/>them about the <hi>Conduct</hi> of the <hi>War;</hi> but they being come before him, he ſaid, Leſt I ſhould ſeem without your advice to act all things according to my own will; I have called you my Lords to Counſel: yet I would have you know, that I expect here from you obedient <hi>minds,</hi> and not trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>debates. Cambyſes,</hi> the Predeceſſor of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> being about to Marry his Siſter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of his Counſellors, whether any Law of the <hi>Perſians</hi> prohibited ſuch a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; They perceiving the King did not ask this queſtion, ſo much to reſolve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of any doubt, as to <hi>Sound</hi> the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> anſwered, That truly there was no <hi>Law</hi> that warranted expreſly this that the King was about to do; but there was one that affirmed, that whatever the King thought fit to do, was <hi>Lawful.</hi> Thus out of the <hi>Humour</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>Nature</hi> of the affair, we muſt firſt make a judgment, whether it be fit, or ſafe, when he asks our <hi>Counſel,</hi> to deliver freely our opinions; or to humour him in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</p>
                  <p>You have <hi>Royal</hi> examples of this already, I will now bring you one of a man, who though he were not a King, yet bore the Office of a King; not above an Age ago in <hi>Spain: Ferdinand</hi> being dead, the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> exhorted <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> then in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to take upon him the title
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98923:24"/>of King of <hi>Spain;</hi> although his Mother <hi>Joan, Ferdinand</hi>'s daughter, were ſtill living, but wholly unfit for Government, by reaſon of her want of health. The States were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aſſembled, and before them Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> to excuſe the novelty of the thing, diſcourſed excellently of the reaſons of what was done. The <hi>Grandees</hi> more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of ancient cuſtoms, and the <hi>Queen,</hi> than was fit againſt a <hi>King</hi> that was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſucceed of Courſe; Proteſted very obſtinately againſt it. <hi>Ximenes</hi> being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, riſes up and tells them, <hi>the thing that was treated of, was not to be called in queſtion; neither was there any need of their advice in the caſe: That Kings being to enter upon their Kingdoms, are not to expect the conſent of their Subjects; that they who were aſſembled, were not called out of any neceſſity, but that they might have occaſion by the Promptitude of their ſuffrages to endear their Prince unto them. But ſince they interpreted that as a due, which was only a favour, they ſhould ſee that without their approbation he would proclaim King</hi> Charles <hi>at</hi> Madrid; which exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all the reſt of the Cities quickly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Such a manner of proceeding, not only in theſe caſes, but moſtly in all others do <hi>Princes</hi> uſe; ſcarce asking any mans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but either to the end they may Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance their own reſolutions with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98923:25"/>of many, or elſe to diſcover the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the perſon they adviſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> witneſſeth that <hi>Tiberius</hi> oft did. The <hi>Courtier</hi> muſt therefore Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitouſly ſift into the <hi>Prince's</hi> mind, leſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he ſhould chance to give offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>Counſel.</hi> If the <hi>Prince's</hi> inclination in the thing debated be <hi>doubtful</hi> unto him, let him ſeem to diſcuſs the matter, and ſo laying down arguments both for the one, and the other ſide, let him leave the <hi>Prince</hi> to his own election: Who (if the thing adviſed of, be not unalterably reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon already) having heard the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that may be brought againſt it, if he be diſcreet, will change his Mind.</p>
                  <p>Neither in this caſe will there be any ground for that <hi>baſhfulneſs</hi> (of bluſhing, to ſeem ſo much inferior to any body, as to follow their Counſel) which though it be very hurtful and unbecoming unto them, is very familiar amongſt <hi>Great Men;</hi> for having ſaid what you can, you leave the freedom of determining all to the <hi>Prince's</hi> Prudence, whereby you will alſo avoid the danger that many times <hi>Counſellors</hi> are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto, if their Advices ſucceed ill. And if the <hi>Prince</hi> following his firſt reſolutions meet not with ſucceſs, he will, by ſo much the more acknowledge and eſteem the prudence of that <hi>Courtier,</hi> who foreſaw the Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>misfortune,</hi> when it was yet avoidable.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98923:25"/>
                  <p>If you be <hi>Preſt</hi> to deliver your opinion in an <hi>unlawful</hi> matter, either ſeek ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>delay,</hi> or elſe intreat that ſome third perſon may be called for the better diſcuſſing of the buſineſs; whereby the caſe being more maturely weighed, it may appear what is moſt for the <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> of the <hi>Prince.</hi> By this means <hi>Burrhus</hi> defeated <hi>Nero</hi>'s firſt attempt againſt his Mother's life; <hi>Promiſing that himſelf would kill her if ſhe were found guilty; But ſince it was afforded unto every other perſon, a trial could not be denied unto his Mother.</hi> Whilſt the examinations are taking, <hi>Nero</hi>'s fury aſſwages, and his Fears grows leſs, ſo that his determination, though it was not quite <hi>altered,</hi> yet it was <hi>laid aſide</hi> to another time.</p>
                  <p>But this manner of proceeding takes not place upon all occaſions, being proper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>deſperate</hi> and <hi>ambiguous</hi> caſes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, before we adventure upon it, we ought to know, whether the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> is compatible with <hi>delays:</hi> for there are ſome ſo <hi>headſtrong</hi> and <hi>impatient,</hi> that there is no means more certain of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> than by uſing <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays.</hi>

                  <p>Now if ſo be, that in that <hi>Headlong</hi> courſe that the <hi>Prince</hi> hath <hi>Wilfully</hi> choſen, <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For it after happens, that the ways which <hi>Princes</hi> propoſe unto themſelves, are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſuch circumſtances of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as are not to be overcome; and to theſe kind of <hi>Straits,</hi> as I would not have you <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him,</hi> ſo I would not have you too much <hi>diſſwade him</hi> from them, (rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him with a <hi>reſpective ſilence</hi> to take his own courſe, leaſt you diſſwading out of theſe <hi>difficult</hi> ways, he ſeek out ſome more <hi>eaſie</hi> one of compaſſing his will;) which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe having <hi>toil'd</hi> himſelf out of breath amongſt the <hi>Obstacles</hi> that he met with, he would voluntarily give the buſineſs over. But ſometimes it falls out that <hi>Princes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the execution of ſome <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> or <hi>Injuſtice</hi> to an honeſt man: In which caſe truly (though all good men ought to ſuffer any violence or misfortune rather than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be made the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>villainy</hi>) I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98923:27"/>fear the number of theſe is very few that are ſo <hi>Generouſly</hi> reſolved, as by a <hi>paſſive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience</hi> to expoſe themſelves to the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for another; eſpecially if the <hi>occaſion</hi> offered, and the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> admits of no denial, or excuſe, nor affords any way of caſting that <hi>diſpleaſing imployment</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome third perſon.</p>
                  <p>Which later courſe <hi>Burrhus</hi> took, <hi>Nero</hi> reſolving the ſecond time upon his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Murther,</hi> full of ſo much the more care and eargerneſs, by how much the danger of her contrived <hi>Shipwrack</hi> in the <hi>Tyber</hi> had produced no other effect, than that the <hi>Woman</hi> always before <hi>malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>greedy</hi> of <hi>revenge,</hi> was after ſo great an injury become more enraged than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Burrhus</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> being call'd to Counſel, ſtood long ambiguous and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what to ſay, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports <hi>Annal.</hi> 14. ſaying: <hi>They were both of them a long time ſilent, fearing leſt they diſſwade in vain; At laſt</hi> Seneca, <hi>hitherto the forwarder man, caſt his eye upon</hi> Burrhus, <hi>as if he would have asked, whether the execution of that Murther ſhould not be left to the Soldiers;</hi> Burrhus <hi>prevented him with an anſwer, and ſays that the</hi> Pretorian Bands <hi>were all devoted to</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar's <hi>houſe, and ſo mindful of</hi> Germanicus, <hi>that they would act nothing of cruelty againſt his Progeny; and therefore that</hi> Anicetus <hi>ſhould perform his promiſe.</hi> So he freed

                  <p>I confeſs, he is not beholding unto <hi>you,</hi> whom, to ſave your ſelf innocent, you ſhall intangle in ſuch an employment: But ſhould ſuch an occaſion happen, I thing it fitter that ſome ſuch man as <hi>Anicetus</hi> was, ſhould undergo the <hi>infamy</hi> of ſuch an act, than any <hi>vertuous</hi> or <hi>honeſt man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet the ſafeſt way of all is in time to <hi>foreſee,</hi> and in their birth to <hi>prevent,</hi> and occur to the <hi>unjuſt deſires,</hi> and the <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſigns</hi> of the <hi>Prince;</hi> and before they either take <hi>Root,</hi> or appear above <hi>Ground,</hi> to ſuppreſs and pull them up.

                  <p>But to do this, there is a great <hi>Nimbleneſs</hi> of <hi>wit,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſantneſs</hi> of <hi>diſcourſe</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; beſides, they muſt take heed the <hi>Prince</hi> ſmell not out, that <hi>himſelf</hi> is the argument of the <hi>Jeſt.</hi> As <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who in the Tragedy of <hi>Atreus,</hi> compoſed by <hi>Scaurus</hi> believed he was reproached of his <hi>Brother</hi>'s murder; and <hi>Domitian,</hi> in that which <hi>Helvidius</hi> had writ of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Cenon,</hi> thought himſelf upbraided with his <hi>divorces:</hi> Wherefore it is neceſſary, that theſe kind of ſtories be skilfully interwoven amongſt other things, not <hi>Squaring</hi> or <hi>Applyable</hi> to the <hi>Prince;</hi> and it is very pertinent to this purpoſe, That they take care not to <hi>Inculcate</hi> too plainly, that <hi>matter</hi> which makes moſt to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; though, leaſt it ſhould quite eſcape the <hi>Prince</hi>'s obſervation, it may be, as it were, by a caſual repetition iterated. The conceit and continuance of the <hi>ſtory,</hi> by how much the greater, and more chearful it is, by ſo much the more it will imprint thoſe things that are ſaid; and becauſe they ſeem to come by <hi>Chance,</hi> not of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> or <hi>Deſign,</hi> they will not diſtaſt the <hi>tickliſh</hi> ear of the <hi>Prince.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this kind of <hi>Moderation,</hi> whereby you may neither <hi>contribute</hi> to the <hi>Prince</hi>'s vices, nor in vain <hi>reſiſt</hi> them; there are many <hi>critical</hi> times, and means, which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98923:28"/>thoſe that attend upon the <hi>perſons,</hi> and are imployed in the affairs of <hi>Princes,</hi> cannot but meet with.

                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving conſidered all things, that our <hi>Courtier</hi> was to obſerve in the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelf, let us come to his <hi>Servants,</hi> who, by reaſon of the Offices they bear, are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually about his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and may be uſeful to thoſe that pretend at <hi>Court,</hi> either by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them <hi>Extraordinary Acceſſes,</hi> or by

                  </p>
                  <p>Who can be ignorant, that during the continuance of the <hi>Eaſtern Empire,</hi> the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> many times Governed all? if that had not been ſo, it had been impoſſible for <hi>Arbetio,</hi> the <hi>Chief Ruler</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> to have eſcaped with life, when <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> accuſed him. <hi>Borilus</hi> and <hi>Germanus,</hi> two ſlaves, by the abſolute Authority they had with <hi>Botoniates,</hi> one of the Emperors, made him an enemy to <hi>Iſacius,</hi> and <hi>Alexius Comnenis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet let us ſuppoſe, That the <hi>Prince</hi> does not impart his <hi>Counſels</hi> to theſe Men, they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98923:37"/>are more eaſily <hi>Pryed</hi> into by theſe, than any others: for it cannot be, that <hi>Princes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wear their <hi>Masks</hi> in private, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Throng,</hi> and a <hi>Publick life,</hi> makes him ſuppreſs and hide thoſe <hi>Affections,</hi> which when he is at liberty, and in private, do break out.

                     <p>Four Kinds of Noble Courtiers: How to be Handled, and made uſe of; how Warily we ought to Deal with Inconſtant Princes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FRom the <hi>Prince's Servarts,</hi> we come to the <hi>Nobles</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> which are of ſundry kinds: There are <hi>ſome Illuſtrious for their Birth, but Deſtitute of the Prince's Favour;</hi> others <hi>in Favour with the Prince, but not Laden with Honors;</hi> a third Sort, <hi>that have Honors and Offices, far exceeding their Intereſt and Favour;</hi> and laſtly; <hi>Thoſe who flouriſh both in Favour, and great Imployments.</hi> The Friendſhip of the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, will perhaps avail our <hi>Courtier</hi> very little, who are nevertheleſs to be <hi>Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>Reſpected,</hi> according to their Quality; leaſt, though they cannot hurt you them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by their <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Followers,</hi> they ſhould do it: For in ſuch <hi>Trains of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies</hi> and <hi>Followers, great Families</hi> are often very powerful, either by reaſon of <hi>Old Benefits,</hi> or reverence to their <hi>greatneſs;</hi> or laſtly, (ſince <hi>Princes</hi> minds are <hi>mutable</hi>) out of reſpect to the <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> theſe <hi>Great Men</hi> may yet chance to come into; with this, or the ſucceeding <hi>Prince.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Archelaus,</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> to his great
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98923:38"/>diſadvantage, did neglect to Honor and Court <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he came to <hi>Rhodes;</hi> for <hi>Tiberius</hi> afterwards meditating <hi>Revenge,</hi> but pretending another <hi>Cauſe,</hi> called him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he <hi>Periſhed</hi> miſerably: Which <hi>Reſpect</hi> nevertheleſs the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> ſays, <hi>He omitted not out of Pride, but for that he was warned by ſome of</hi> Auguſtus <hi>his Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, That whilſt</hi> Caius Caeſar <hi>flouriſhed and was ſent into the Eaſt, the Friendſhip of</hi> Tiberius <hi>ſeemed unſafe.</hi> We muſt look there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon theſe <hi>Great Men</hi> of Fortune, though not able to <hi>deſerve well of us,</hi> yet powerful enough to <hi>Hurt us:</hi> And though they be unacceptable and ſuſpected by the <hi>Prince,</hi> we muſt yet <hi>Reverence them,</hi> to avoid the <hi>Blame of others,</hi> and <hi>their Emnity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it chance, that the <hi>Prince</hi> will oppoſe you to one of theſe <hi>Great Ones,</hi> as it is uſual with <hi>Princes</hi> to do; as you muſt not <hi>Refuſe</hi> the <hi>Task,</hi> ſo you muſt with great <hi>Art, Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,</hi> and <hi>Choice of Occaſions,</hi> undertake it; taking care that you may both <hi>Satisfie</hi> the <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>juſtifie</hi> your endeavors to <hi>other men:</hi> It is an enterprize-full of <hi>Danger,</hi> but if at the <hi>Prince</hi>'s inſtance, it be taken in hand, it is the way to riſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet after you are once ingaged in one of theſe <hi>Brigues,</hi> there are the choice of two ways to be taken, according to the nature of the <hi>Prince you act for,</hi> the <hi>Perſons you have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98923:38"/>to do with</hi> and the <hi>Times you are in:</hi> Some men <hi>act</hi> all theſe things in their <hi>own name</hi> ſo <hi>boldly,</hi> and with ſo <hi>High a hand,</hi> That all kind of men, except thoſe that are <hi>Great</hi> indeed, ſtrike eaſily <hi>Sail</hi> unto them for fear of <hi>offending</hi> the <hi>Prince;</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves (as they believe) all theſe <hi>men Say</hi> or <hi>Do.</hi> There are others yet, that take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe more ſafe and ſweet, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <hi>Waiting</hi> upon the <hi>Prince,</hi> their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> in whom they will <hi>make no ſhew of,</hi> but upon the <hi>Beſt Opportunities;</hi> neither will they take any occaſion for theſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,</hi> but ſuch as with <hi>Great Choice</hi> they have <hi>Selected,</hi> as both likely to <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;</hi> and having took effect, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound</hi> much to the <hi>Advantage</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Publick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For you muſt take great heed you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take nothing you cannot go through with; for beſides that, the <hi>Common People</hi> judge of all things by the <hi>Event,</hi> believing ſtill, that <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> are on the ſide that <hi>Fortune</hi> is; by <hi>Ill ſucceſſes,</hi> you will ſoon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the <hi>Eſteem</hi> and <hi>Favour,</hi> you have with the <hi>Prince.</hi> For he to take away the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace</hi> received, and by reaſon, That he fears either to be <hi>Deſpiſed</hi> of his <hi>Subjects</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned</hi> by his <hi>Enemies,</hi> whom he hath oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>vain,</hi> will be compelled to remove his <hi>Favour from,</hi> and <hi>Abandon you.</hi>

                  <p>Beware, that when I ſpeak of your <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:98923:39"/>with theſe <hi>Great Perſons,</hi> that you underſtand not, that I wiſh you to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle, when you ſee it cannot be done with <hi>Tumult,</hi> or that you ſhould provoke them with <hi>Contumelies</hi> and <hi>Reproaches,</hi> for that becomes onely a <hi>Baſe Soul,</hi> whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>Corrupted</hi> by <hi>Fortune:</hi> The end of which kind of men is ſeldom happy; as is to be obſerved in <hi>Piſo,</hi> whom <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſent into <hi>Syria,</hi> to <hi>Croſs</hi> the <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns</hi> of <hi>Germanicus;</hi> againſt whom he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelf ſo <hi>Inſolently,</hi> that when Prince <hi>Germanicus</hi> was dead, <hi>Caeſar</hi> was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and abandon <hi>Piſo</hi> to the <hi>publick Hate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I adviſe you to oppoſe theſe <hi>Great Men,</hi> it is in <hi>Caſes</hi> onely, wherein they are to do ſomething that is <hi>unjuſt,</hi> or againſt the <hi>Publick good,</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> or that is prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Army,</hi> or the <hi>Treaſures</hi> of the Kingdom: In which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, you muſt ſo comport your ſelf with <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Modeſty,</hi> that all others that are <hi>Concerned,</hi> and all <hi>Honeſt men</hi> may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that what you do, proceeds not out of any <hi>private Enmity,</hi> but onely from your <hi>zeal</hi> to the <hi>Publick good.</hi> If you demand an example to imitate, behold Cardinal <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> choſen by <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Queen of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> on purpoſe to <hi>Tug</hi> with thoſe <hi>Grandees,</hi> that were not ſo ſubject to the <hi>King</hi>'s pleaſure, as they are now: Of a <hi>Franciſcan Frier,</hi> he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98923:39"/>was firſt made the Queen's <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the advice of Cardinal <hi>Mendoza,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> and Inquiſitor Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Spain;</hi> which <hi>Offices</hi> he bore with great Authority, being there during the whole Reign of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and was even to the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, the ſole <hi>Arbiter</hi> and <hi>Moderator</hi> of all <hi>Affairs;</hi> ever contending with the <hi>Great Ones,</hi> but ſo diſcreetly, That he always held both the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People</hi> faſt unto him.</p>
                  <p>It is reported that he was <hi>Poyſoned,</hi> and he himſelf ſuſpected it, but the fact could never be proved. Wherefore it is better to attribute ſo <hi>Late a Death</hi> as his (for he was very old) to <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, ſince he preſerved his <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> (both which he owed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to his own induſtry) <hi>Entire</hi> unto his <hi>End. Chico Simoneta</hi> had not ſo good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, who whilſt <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> ruled in <hi>Milan,</hi> was called to the helm of <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and afterwards choſen by young <hi>Galeaeius</hi>'s Mother, by reaſon of his known fidelity and experience in Publick Affairs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with his <hi>Maſter's Brethren.</hi> He to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Dukedom</hi> for <hi>Galeacious,</hi> baniſhed <hi>Galeacius</hi>'s Brothers, and <hi>Robert de St. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> out of <hi>Milan,</hi> with how much envy you may imagine: Yet ſee how wickedly he was afterwards deſerted, for the Widow,

                     <p>The Three other kinds of Noble Courtiers; How they are to be Dealt with.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere are a ſecond kind of <hi>Noble Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi> (as I ſaid before) who are in <hi>Favour</hi> with the <hi>Prince,</hi> and yet not very eminent in any <hi>Dignity</hi> or <hi>Imployment.</hi> Theſe though they can Contribute nothing elſe unto us, may <hi>make our Way</hi> unto the <hi>King,</hi> Seaſonable and Eaſie, beſides they may be uſeful in <hi>Calling</hi> to mind our <hi>Deſerts,</hi> or if occaſion require, in <hi>Excuſing our Errors;</hi> protecting us alſo from the <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Detractions</hi> of our <hi>Enemies;</hi> by which means, if they be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our <hi>Friends,</hi> they may ſerve us <hi>Highly;</hi> as on the contrary ſide, if they be our <hi>Foes;</hi> they may <hi>Prejudice</hi> us exceedingly: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98923:40"/>we muſt ſeek the <hi>Friendſhip of theſe Men,</hi> by all means, that are not <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy</hi> our condition; and we muſt conſider, that they ſeldom ſtay any long time about a <hi>Prince,</hi> unexalted to <hi>Honour:</hi> Nay, ſuppoſe that for ſome reaſon or other, they be not <hi>Advanced,</hi> yet by their <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Commendations,</hi> they do <hi>Advance their Friends,</hi> and lift them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, though either <hi>Equal</hi> or <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> to them in <hi>Deſert.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third ſort of <hi>Nobles,</hi> are thoſe who are in great <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> and have a great ſhare in <hi>publick Buſineſs,</hi> and yet have little intereſt in the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Favour. And theſe kind of men are chiefly found about ſuch <hi>Princes,</hi> who live quietly, attending to their <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> mindleſs of <hi>Publick Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,</hi> which they commit wholly to one or two of their <hi>Tryed Servants,</hi> abhorring the <hi>Trouble</hi> that is attending it themſelves. In ſuch a <hi>Court</hi> as this, we muſt rather ſeek the <hi>Favour</hi> of theſe <hi>Miniſters,</hi> than of the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelf; who ſince he truſts them with the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of his <hi>Affairs,</hi> leaves alſo the choice of his <hi>Officers</hi> to theſe men, being himſelf unfit to chuſe <hi>Men for Duties,</hi> which he knows nothing what belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Chiefly we muſt beware of <hi>Threats,</hi> if we be <hi>not Ready,</hi> and ſure to <hi>Execute</hi> them; for <hi>Threats</hi> do both <hi>Warn</hi> our adverſary to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi> and <hi>Provoke his Hatred</hi> to <hi>Double our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries;</hi> affording us nothing but <hi>Shame,</hi> in ſeeming to <hi>Breath Revenge;</hi> but to be <hi>Deſtitute of Power.</hi> I know this kind of Moderation will not be approved by all kind of men, eſpecially ſuch as are <hi>Greedy</hi> after <hi>Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> who think no <hi>Injury</hi> is to be paſſed over without Reſentment, not only by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> that is found in <hi>Revenge;</hi> but alſo, becauſe they ſay by ſuffering one <hi>Injury,</hi> you invite another; wherefore we muſt <hi>Perſecute</hi> thoſe that offend us with an <hi>Immortal Hate:</hi> But theſe men whilſt they deſire to <hi>Render</hi> themſelves <hi>Formidable,</hi> do effect nothing elſe but make all men flie
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98923:44"/>their <hi>Company.</hi> For ſince we <hi>Mortals</hi> are <hi>Creatures</hi> prone to <hi>Falls,</hi> and <hi>Slips,</hi> and are carried away ſometimes with <hi>Affection,</hi> and at other times with <hi>Paſſion;</hi> and in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, every one for <hi>Fear of Offending,</hi> will flie from theſe kind of <hi>Malignant, Raſh,</hi> and <hi>Revengeful perſons;</hi> and as <hi>Wild beaſts</hi> leave them to their own <hi>Solitude.</hi> Since, if any one Offends one of them, he muſt expect all that <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> can afford at his hands.

                  <p>For this Reaſon therefore, for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>theſe Evils,</hi> I think the contrary way is to be choſen, and <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> to be <hi>Preferred</hi> which truly, in the <hi>Greateſt Injuries</hi> is not hard to be <hi>Perſonated,</hi> when we conſider the <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Conſequences</hi> of a <hi>Paſſionate Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the <hi>Condition</hi> of the perſons from whom we receive them. In <hi>Lighter Injuries,</hi> that we ſee ariſe rather out of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> than <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Deſign,</hi> we ought to be ſo little offended with them, that it may not be perceived we are <hi>Senſible of them.</hi> If the <hi>Injury</hi> is Great and Foul, we muſt not ſhow our ſelves wholly careleſs of our <hi>Eſteem</hi> and <hi>Reputation;</hi> yet without ſeeming too <hi>Impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable</hi> towards them that provoked us, as they may have Reaſon to think there is no <hi>Hope of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98923:45"/>a Reconcilement,</hi> or place for <hi>Pardon</hi> upon any <hi>Reaſonable Satisfaction</hi> left them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be pertinent in this caſe to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain unto his Friends</hi> that hath injured us, of our <hi>Wrongs,</hi> and to make them <hi>judge</hi> of our <hi>Difference.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Injuries that are offered in a <hi>Petulant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Humor,</hi> I think ought to be preſently vindicated, not ſo much out of a <hi>Deſire of Revenge,</hi> as for the <hi>Chaſtiſement</hi> of him that did them; and to <hi>Teach</hi> him how to <hi>Demean Himſelf</hi> more Modeſtly hereafter, as well towards <hi>Others,</hi> as Our <hi>Selves.</hi> But theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries alſo are not to be Proſecuted with an <hi>Inveterate Hatred,</hi> nay, we ought to declare, that the <hi>Neceſſity of Complaint,</hi> and ſeeking Revenge <hi>is Put upon us,</hi> and that we are ready to be friends after a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> given us, that is any way <hi>Compatible</hi> with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi> we received.

                  <p>BEcauſe theſe kinds of <hi>Injuries</hi> are done, for the moſt part, by <hi>Thoſe</hi> that are much <hi>More Powerful</hi> than <hi>Our ſelves,</hi> and who have ſome way or other, great advantage of us: The <hi>Firſt way</hi> to avoid them, is to <hi>Treat</hi> Theſe kind of men <hi>Reſpectfully,</hi> and to Avoid all <hi>Freedoms</hi> as much as may be with <hi>Them:</hi> Or if they be very <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nruly,</hi> to <hi>Flie their Converſation</hi> altogether. This ſaying of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> is in this caſe very notable.</p>

                     <l>Wouldſt thou avoid what may Diſpleaſe?</l>
                     <l>Or ſeek'ſt thou for Content and Eaſe?</l>
                     <l>With no man be thou over Free;</l>
                     <l>As joys, ſo Griefs will Fewer be.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>Second Way</hi> will be, as I ſaid more than once before, to ſeem. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſenſible</hi> of the <hi>Wrong;</hi> for it is neither <hi>Safe</hi> nor <hi>Prudent</hi> for us, to ſtrive too much with One that is too <hi>Powerful</hi> for us; and the Inequality, of our <hi>Forces,</hi> will be a juſt pretence to excuſe our <hi>Diſſimulation.</hi> I know there are ſome that are perſwaded, That if we can but <hi>Eright
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98923:46"/>our Adverſaries,</hi> they would ſoon <hi>ſeek unto us,</hi> and deſire to be Reconciled; and I do not deny that there are ſome <hi>Slie Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that will <hi>Deſcend</hi> to do ſo; but believe me, it is always a <hi>Dangerous. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſound,</hi> and <hi>Faint</hi> Reconciliation: And theſe will ſeldom or never omit (if an occaſion of <hi>Injury</hi> Preſent it ſelf) to give way to their <hi>Diſpoſition;</hi> which is by ſo much the more <hi>Revengeful,</hi> by how much their <hi>Diſſembling</hi> was the <hi>Tamer;</hi> beſides, a <hi>Private Enemy</hi> is harder to be <hi>taken heed</hi> of, than one that is <hi>Publickly</hi> ſo.

                  </p>
                  <p>For if we have to do with one that is much <hi>Superior to us,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Enmities</hi> will ſtand in our <hi>Light,</hi> it is better to have a <hi>Feigned Friendſhip,</hi> than open <hi>Enmity</hi> with him; though he <hi>Offer us the Wrong,</hi> yet we muſt endeavor by the <hi>Mediation of Friends</hi> to appeaſe him, as if <hi>We had done the Injury.</hi> To diſcern who is moſt able and likely to <hi>Prejudice</hi> us, we muſt conſider not only their <hi>Power,</hi> but alſo the nature of their <hi>Malice</hi> towards us; for ſome have a <hi>Deſire of Revenge,</hi> like a handmaid, always waiting upon their <hi>Hate;</hi> others a <hi>Fear,</hi> leſt that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got what we <hi>Aſpire unto,</hi> we ſhould be

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98923:49"/>at the <hi>Queen</hi>'s direction, preſt him to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it: And having Accepted of it, he was fain to be ſo intreated over again, before he could be perſwaded to live in a <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Splendour</hi> equal to his <hi>Dignity;</hi> nay, after that, he was <hi>Perſonally</hi> ſo <hi>Obſervant</hi> of his former manner of life, in this great <hi>Fortune,</hi> that no way elſe, but by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Expreſs Command, could he be induced to change it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Modeſty</hi> ſucceeded ſo well with him, that hereby he Appeaſed and Avoided that <hi>Great Envy,</hi> which muſt otherwiſe of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have Oppreſſed him, being the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of a Dignity <hi>Gaped after,</hi> by all the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of <hi>Revenue</hi> ſcarce inferiour to thoſe of the <hi>Crown.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>How we muſt, not only Take Care to Preſerve the Prince's Favour, but alſo That of Thoſe in Power about him.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is not enough that the <hi>Princes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be not <hi>Averſe</hi> unto us, but we muſt alſo keep our ſelves <hi>Aright</hi> with thoſe that are in <hi>Favour with them. Germanicus</hi> at his death, gave that advice to <hi>Agrippina</hi> his Wife, of which <hi>Tacitus,</hi> Annal. 2 ſpeaks thus. <hi>Then turning to his Wife, he intreated her by his Memory, and for their Children ſake, which were common to them both, That ſhe would pull down her ſtomach, and ſubmit her Great heart to the rage of Fortune; leſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the City, ſhe ſhould with Emulation of her Greatneſs, ſtir up againſt her, perſons more powerful than her ſelf; Agrippina</hi>'s neglect of this <hi>Document,</hi> Ruined her and her children, I told you before, how much <hi>Eumenes</hi> his favour was diminiſhed with <hi>Alexander;</hi> after that, railing againſt <hi>Hephaeſtion,</hi> he carried himſelf irreverently towards the <hi>Prince;</hi> and diſcovered his <hi>Spleen</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> to him that he accuſed.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, when we ſee any one in the <hi>Prince</hi>'s favour, we muſt carefully weigh his <hi>Authority,</hi> and compare it, as it were, in a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98923:59"/>
                     <hi>Balance</hi> againſt our own; that we may know certainly which weighs down the other: And in the tryal of this, we are not ſo much to obſerve <hi>Outward Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi> as the circumſtances of <hi>Inward Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Craterus</hi> and <hi>Hephaeſtion,</hi> for a time did flouriſh both of them, in <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Equal Favour</hi> with <hi>Alexander;</hi> until <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> himſelf determined the buſineſs, in calling one of them, The <hi>Kings</hi> friend, and the other, <hi>Alexander</hi>'s friends.</p>
                  <p>Out of which deciſion <hi>Craterus</hi> might have made this judgment, That ſince <hi>Princes,</hi> for the moſt part, are more in love with their <hi>Own Wills,</hi> than their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> they alſo are held <hi>More Dear</hi> unto them, who rather adore and worſhip <hi>Alexander,</hi> that is their <hi>Perſon,</hi> than their <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Kingly Dignity:</hi> And though that afterward upon a ſtrife that aroſe between <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Hephaeſtion,</hi> when all the Court was divided into <hi>Factions, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſeemed to incline to neither ſide; but chiding them both heavily threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned puniſhment, if ever they ſhould <hi>Harp upon that ſtring again;</hi> yet his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dealing with them, ſhewed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Singular Prudence,</hi> to be imitated by all <hi>Princes,</hi> than his <hi>Equal Affection</hi> to them both. He apprehended, that this Diſcord might produce <hi>Great Tuinults,</hi> and <hi>Miſchief;</hi> For he knew both <hi>Craterus</hi> his great intereſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98923:59"/>in the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and how much <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeſtion</hi> was Envied for his favour to him. Therefore to diminiſh <hi>Hephaeſtion</hi>'s Envy, he reprehended him publickly; and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void giving offence to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he Reproved <hi>Craterus</hi> in private.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt thoſe that in this tryal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s favour, between <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> were out of <hi>negligence</hi> and in <hi>diſcretion,</hi> moſt groſly Miſtaken: <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Primus</hi> ought to have the firſt place, who daring to contend with <hi>Mutianus,</hi> learnt at laſt, That he had better have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted with <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> himſelf. And in this manner, you will find it is a thing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by the <hi>examples</hi> of all Courts, <hi>To vindicate more ſharply an injury againſt the Favourites, than againſt the Prince himſelf. Dio</hi> tells us the reaſon of it, when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted how the ſame thing happened to <hi>Sejanus,</hi> thus, <hi>As thoſe whom vertue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of their own Deſerts, hath lifted up to Dignities, do not much ſtick upon the vain Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and outward Circumſtances of Honor: So on the contrary ſide, thoſe who ſeek to climb by Ambition, Pride, and Vice, thereby to hide their unworthineſs, and meanneſs, do preſently take ill, and underſtand as a contempt, the leaſt neglect of Ceremony, and reſpect towards them.</hi> Inſomuch, that it is harder to preſerve the <hi>friendſhip</hi> of theſe men, than of the <hi>Prince</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:98923:60"/>himſelf, for he thinks it a <hi>Glorious</hi> and <hi>Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Act to forgive <hi>Injuries:</hi> When theſe, leſt they ſhould ſeem to <hi>Remit</hi> that which they cannot <hi>Revenge,</hi> even to oſtentation, do uſe their <hi>Borrowed Power,</hi> in perſecuting thoſe that have offended them.</p>

                     <p>Pride even in the Meaneſt Perſons at Court, noted with Examples; as alſo Treachery in Betraying the Prince's Secrets.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NEither truly hath it been <hi>Deſtruction</hi> to <hi>Great Ones</hi> only, to have carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Inſolently</hi> and <hi>Amiſs,</hi> but alſo to Men of the <hi>Lower Stage. John</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> loved <hi>Alvarez de Luna</hi> ſo much, that he Truſted him with all his <hi>Affairs,</hi> and even his <hi>Kingly Power</hi> it ſelf, notwithſtanding the Repining of all his <hi>Nobles.</hi> But when he by reaſon of his proſperous Fortune, fell into that <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Preſumption.</hi> That he cauſed a <hi>Nobleman,</hi> who in the <hi>King's name</hi> admoniſhed him of his <hi>Duty,</hi> to be <hi>Precipitated</hi> and <hi>Murthered;</hi> he was by the <hi>King's</hi> command beheaded. It is alſo an ordinary cauſe of <hi>ſhipwrack</hi> in <hi>Court,</hi> when any one hath rendred, either himſelf,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98923:60"/>or the <hi>Prince,</hi> Hateful to the <hi>Peers,</hi> or <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> For, either the <hi>Prince</hi> is fain of his own accord, to caſt ſuch a one off, to Rid himſelf of <hi>Envy,</hi> or elſe others never leave, till they have <hi>Overthrown him.</hi> During the Reign of <hi>Commodus, Cleander</hi> once armed the <hi>Pretori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Guards</hi> againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> People; which was a ground of ſo great tumults in <hi>Rome,</hi> that unleſs the <hi>Emperor</hi> had Sacrifiecd <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to the Peoples Fury, he himſelf could not have been <hi>Secure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Commodus,</hi> had Rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Odious to all Men, by his Affection to one <hi>Anterus;</hi> from which envy, that they might Free their <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſome of <hi>Commodus</hi> his Servants being very deſirous, ſlew this <hi>Anterus</hi> as he was coming from <hi>Court. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius,</hi> who had been long dear to <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> ſince he was believed to be the Author of the <hi>Sedition</hi> raiſed by <hi>Tribigildus,</hi> was given up, as a Price of the <hi>Peace,</hi> by the <hi>Prince,</hi> to the <hi>Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amongſt the Evils that ſubvert Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, there are <hi>two</hi> remaining yet, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, ſo very frequent; <hi>A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of the Prince's Secrets,</hi> and <hi>Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with his Enemies.</hi> Crimes, for the moſt part, ariſing out of <hi>Perfidy,</hi> but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times alſo out of <hi>Levity,</hi> and <hi>Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> onely. And foraſmuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>Secrets of Princes,</hi> I think they do very well, <hi>who Pry not into them;</hi> and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98923:61"/>who, if their <hi>Office exact it not at their hands</hi> avoid the <hi>bare knowledge</hi> of them: For if you be the <hi>Onely perſon,</hi> to whom they are imparted, and <hi>Fame</hi> (which often makes <hi>witty Conjectures</hi>) chance to ſcatter any thing like unto them, you cannot avoid the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, that the <hi>Secret</hi> came out by you: And although the <hi>Prince</hi> perhaps hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted it to ſome <hi>one elſe,</hi> yet it may fall out ſo, that he hath forgot; or elſe, that he is more Confident of the <hi>other mans ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> and ſo the foil remain upon you ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Not without cauſe, did <hi>Philippides</hi> the <hi>Comick Poet,</hi> when he was asked by King <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> (to whom he was very dear) of what things he did chiefly deſire to be made partaker by his <hi>Prince,</hi> anſwer, That he would refuſe nothing that came from the <hi>Prince,</hi> his <hi>Secrets</hi> onely excepted; from which he deſired to be Excuſed. Let us learn from the example of this man, as much as we can, and eſteem it ſafer to be Ignorant of <hi>Secrets,</hi> ſo difficult and dangerous to be kept, than to Know them. <hi>Hiero,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> was wont to ſay, That thoſe who diſcover <hi>Princes</hi> ſecrets, do wrong both <hi>to Themſelves,</hi> and <hi>to Thoſe they Impart them unto</hi> by expoſing them alſo together with themſelves, to the hatred of the <hi>Prince.</hi>

                  <p>When either the beginning of a <hi>War,</hi> or breaking of a <hi>Peace,</hi> is Treated of; the part of a wiſe Counſellor is to bring Arguments for <hi>Both Sides,</hi> and leave the <hi>Prince</hi> at Liberty to make Choice of <hi>What Likes him beſt.</hi> And if he be Preſt to deliver his Opinion, it will be the Safer Courſe to <hi>Incline to Peace;</hi> unleſs <hi>Invincible Neceſſity,</hi> or <hi>an Apparent Advantage,</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THus much for the <hi>Firſt way,</hi> whereby <hi>Courtiers</hi> are by their Enemies <hi>Supplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and ſtript of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Favor. Now let us come to the <hi>Second,</hi> which are, The <hi>Calumnies</hi> that are uſed to Render us <hi>Hated</hi> and <hi>Suſpected</hi> by the <hi>Prince:</hi> In <hi>Calumny,</hi> two things are to be Obſerved; the firſt is, <hi>Whether it be ſufficient to Deprive him of the Prince's Favor?</hi> the ſecond is, <hi>Whether it be Probable?</hi> Of the firſt, We muſt make our judgment out of the <hi>Preſent State of Things,</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:98923:66"/>out of the <hi>Humor and Inclination of the Prince,</hi> and out of the <hi>Nature of the Calumny intended.</hi> No kind of <hi>Slander</hi> doth ſubvert more <hi>Great Men,</hi> than that which Accuſes us of Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Perſon, or his <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> or elſe of <hi>Contempt,</hi> or <hi>Diſdaining</hi> to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, with <hi>Detraction,</hi> and <hi>Deriſion</hi> towards the <hi>Prince.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Calumnies</hi> are Rendred likely to be True, not onely by the <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> of thoſe that are <hi>Accuſed,</hi> and of their <hi>Servants, Friends,</hi> and <hi>Kindred,</hi> but alſo by Contrived <hi>Letters,</hi> and the <hi>Diſpoſition of the Prince;</hi> too Apt to believe the <hi>Calumny,</hi> or too Prone to <hi>think Ill of the Perſon Accuſed;</hi> eſpecially, if he were ever ſuſpected before. Theſe things which are by <hi>Calumny</hi> converted into a <hi>Crime,</hi> he that is Traduced, either <hi>Did,</hi> or <hi>ſaid</hi> of his <hi>Own Accord,</hi> or elſe was <hi>Ticed into them</hi> by the ſleights of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and <hi>Competitors:</hi> The knowledge and practice of which <hi>Malice,</hi> whets the wits of thoſe who will <hi>Curiouſly Watch their Occaſions,</hi> and know dexterouſly <hi>How to uſe them.</hi>

                        <hi>Junius Silanus</hi> and <hi>Silius Nerva,</hi> being Conſuls, the year had a foul beginning; for <hi>Titius Sabinus,</hi> an honourable Gentleman
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98923:68"/>of <hi>Rome,</hi> was caſt into Priſon onely for his Friendſhip to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> which was ſuch, That he never omitted any occaſion of honouring or ſerving his Wife and Children; Of all <hi>Germanicus</hi> his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, being the onely Man which Viſited them at their houſe, and Accompanied them abroad; wherefore as he was much praiſed by the Good, ſo was he much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liced by the Bad: Againſt him, <hi>Latinius Latiani, Porcius Cato, Petilius Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Opſius,</hi> who had ſometime been Conſuls, bent their Spight, through a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Conſulſhip, which they could not obtain, but by <hi>Sejanus</hi> his means, and <hi>Sejanus</hi> his liberty could not be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but by ſome notable piece of Villainy. Wherefore they plotted amongſt them, That <hi>Latiani,</hi> who was ſomewhat a-kin to <hi>Sabinus,</hi> ſhould lay the ſnare, and that the reſt being privately witneſſes to what paſt, they might begin their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon <hi>Latiani</hi> began at firſt to caſt Speeches out at Random, and to Extol <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus</hi> his Conſtancy, that he did not as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, Fawn in Proſperity, and Shrink from a houſe in Adverſity; with other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable mention of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> bewayling <hi>Agrippina</hi>'s eſtate. And ſeeing <hi>Sabinus</hi> (as Mens Minds are ſoft and tender in Calamity) to pour down Tears, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98923:69"/>complaints; <hi>Latiani</hi> began more boldly to touch <hi>Sejanus</hi>'s Cruelty, Pride, and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not forbearing to reproach <hi>Tiberius;</hi> Theſe ſeeming dangerous Speeches, and ſuch as durſt not be avouched, made a ſtrict friendſhip in ſhew between them: So far, that <hi>Sabinus</hi> often frequented <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiani</hi>'s houſe, and as unto his Faithful Friend uttered his Griefs unto him. Thoſe I mentioned before, now began to deviſe with <hi>Latiani,</hi> how theſe Speeches might be heard by them all: For the place of Meeting, muſt be, in appearance, private; and if they ſhould ſtand behind the door, they did apprehend ſome noiſe, or other accident of ſuſpicion might diſcover them; wherefore, between the Cieling and the Roof, the Three Senators (in a place no leſs Unſeemly, than the Treachery was deteſtable) hid themſelves, laying their ears cloſe to the Holes and Chinks, to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten what was ſaid.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Latiani</hi> having found <hi>Sabinus</hi> in the Market-place (as if he had ſome New Matter to tell him) inticeth him home into his Chamber, beginning there to rip up things paſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in a great abundance; and to load him with new Fears. <hi>Sabinus</hi> was not behind hand with him, the nature of griefs being ſuch, that when once we enter into them, we
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98923:69"/>can hardly make an end. This done, they began immediately their accuſation, and writ unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the whole contrivance of their own Lewd and Shameful Act. The City was never in Greater Perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and fear than at that time, Every man eſtranging himſelf from his neareſt Kindred, and acquaintance; avoiding all Meetings and Conferences as well with their Friends, as Strangers; yea they grew jealous of mute, and ſenſe leſs things, Prying into the Roofs and Walls of their houſes. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting in his Letters that the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the new year might be Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated on the <hi>Calends of January,</hi> falls at laſt upon <hi>Sabinus,</hi> Charging him that he had corrupted ſome of his Freed-men to Attempt ſomething againſt his Perſon, and therefore boldly demandeth a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which without delay was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sabinus</hi> being Condemned, was drawn and haled away with his Garments over his head, ſo that he being almoſt Throtled was heard to cry out: <hi>Is this the beginnings of the new year? be theſe the ſacrifices ſlain in</hi> Sejanus <hi>his honor?</hi> Which way ſoever he did caſt his Eyes they all fled that he directed his ſpeech unto; the places of Aſſembly and the Streets were Empty, ſome came running back and ſhowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

And what days think you now were Exempt from Executions, if amongſt the ſacrifices, and the vows, when the cuſtom was to abſtain from profane ſpeeches, Fetters and Manacles were mentioned. It is believed <hi>Tiberius</hi> could not be ignorant of the Envy he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur for doing ſo, but that he did it on purpoſe, to the end the new Magiſtrates might open the priſons, when they ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their Temples and their Altars.

                  <p>This <hi>Story</hi> leads me to ſpeak of another means of Rendring Slanders probable, to wit, by <hi>Counterfeiting Letters; A Deceit</hi> indeed that for the moſt part breaks out at laſt to the prejudice of him that uſes it, but nevertheleſs is of great Power to make deep impreſſions of ſuſpicion in the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Mind, and to Alienate <hi>his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:</hi> Which being once obſerved <hi>by the Accuſed,</hi> will either induce him to <hi>Withdraw himſelf willingly</hi> from <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and the <hi>Court,</hi> leaſt ſomething worſe ſhould follow; or elſe caſt him upon ſuch Attempts and Practices, as will <hi>Confirm the Slander.</hi> Which appears by that example of <hi>Sylvanus</hi> I mentioned before.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Jealouſie and Envy of Princes,</hi> hath been ſo formidable to ſome, that they had rather be <hi>Leſſened</hi> to their <hi>Loſs,</hi> than incur their <hi>Envy</hi> by doing their buſineſs <hi>Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly</hi> and well. <hi>Publius Ventidius</hi> fearing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98923:77"/>the Envy of <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> under whom he ſerved, Contented himſelf to have beaten the <hi>Parthians</hi> by Three Victories into <hi>Media,</hi> and would not proſecute his <hi>Good Fortune</hi> any farther. <hi>Agathias</hi> tells us, that during the Reign of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> the ſame was done by <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> leaſt the Greatneſs of his Victories, and the Acclamations of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhould ſtir up the <hi>Hate</hi> of the <hi>Peers,</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Truly ſuch as theſe do not Mind their own Honor, and the Profit of the <hi>Prince,</hi> as they ought to do; but the fault is not ſo much in them, as in the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelf; And therefore it was, that <hi>Maecenas</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded <hi>Auguſtus, not to Impute his Ill Succeſſes to his Miniſters, nor Envy their Proſperous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>many of them that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Publick Affairs, have done it very Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, for fear of Envy chooſing rather to hazard their Glory, than their Safety.</hi> Yet I do much more Approve their way, who to avoid <hi>Envy,</hi> what ever Great and Fortunate Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they did, would needs <hi>Aſcribe the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it to the Prince,</hi> though <hi>abſent. Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, Auguſtus</hi> his Son in Law, perſwades us to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertake Great Adventures;</hi> but having performed them to <hi>Attribute the Glory of it to the Prince,</hi> as he himſelf was always wont to do.</p>

                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:98923:77"/>himſelf came thither. <hi>Craterus,</hi> when the buſineſs of <hi>Artacena</hi> was to be Determined, waits for <hi>Alexander</hi>'s coming; <hi>Julius Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi> (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> Writes) <hi>never did Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Apply his Acts to his own Glory, but Caſt all upon Fortune, as the Author and Guide of All he did, who was but her ſervant.</hi>

                  <p>LEt our <hi>Courtier</hi> Avoid all <hi>Ostentation</hi> of the <hi>Prince's Favor,</hi> not onely to Avoid the <hi>Envy</hi> of the Reſt of his <hi>Companions,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelf: For lately, when the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> went about to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant Cardinal <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> under <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, See with what a <hi>Wile</hi> they Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him: They all <hi>Struck Sail</hi> to him, they all ſeemed <hi>to Acknowledge, that their Fortunes Depended upon His Favor;</hi> the very <hi>Domeſtick Servants</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> ſhewed themſelves very <hi>Obedient, and Ready at his Beck:</hi> Which when the <hi>Prince</hi> obſerved, he was removed from <hi>Court,</hi> and all that <hi>power</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs</hi> which he had Acquired, in leſs than Two years fell to Nothing.</p>
                  <p>Let therefore our <hi>Courtier</hi> learn to be Contented with <hi>a Modeſt Train of Attendants,</hi> and with <hi>a Rate of living</hi> rather Beneath the Dignity wherewith he is honoured by the <hi>Prince,</hi> than Above it; which he muſt be ſure <hi>Never to exceed.</hi> It is Unſeaſonable to leſſen your Attendants, when your <hi>Fortune is Declining.</hi> It availed <hi>Seneca</hi> nothing, after

                     <p>How to Make a Judgment of the Conſtancy, or Change of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's Affection to us.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>TO the end our <hi>Courtier</hi> may judge of <hi>Conſtancy</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Favour</hi> towards him, It is not Enough that he know the <hi>Prince's Humor,</hi> with the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> both of his <hi>Friends and Enemies in Court;</hi> but he muſt Principally weigh the <hi>Original Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Prince's Love</hi> towards him: For, if <hi>That once Ceaſe,</hi> or be found more <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in Another,</hi> without doubt, the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the <hi>Prince</hi> will either wholly <hi>Cool,</hi> or at leaſt be <hi>much Diminiſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet ſometimes it is hard to Divine what is the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that you are ſo <hi>Beloved;</hi> and truly, it is ſometimes only a <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Felicity,</hi> for which no Reaſon can be given, though ordinarily the <hi>Prince</hi>'s love ariſes, either out of <hi>Similitude of Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> out of the <hi>Pleaſingneſs of your Humor and Manners,</hi> out of your <hi>Services Done him,</hi> or from <hi>your Vertue;</hi> or laſtly, from your <hi>Obſequious Pliableneſs to his Will,</hi> That love which comes from the <hi>ſimilitude or Takingneſs of your Manners,</hi> although it ſeem very <hi>Great for a Time,</hi> yet it wears out <hi>Sooneſt of all;</hi> both, becauſe as we have ſaid before
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98923:83"/>the Nature of man Changes daily with Age, or with Variety of Buſineſs; and alſo becauſe it is Hard to find two Diſpoſitions ſo Symphathizing together, as that they Differ in nothing; and many times that wherein they differ, is of more Power to Divide them, than all the reſt to Unite them together.</p>
                  <p>Yet I know not <hi>what Star</hi> doth ſo <hi>Tune</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> ſome men ſtill to the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Liking, and Diſpoſition, that they can Hardly, if they would, do any <hi>Diſſonant or Diſpleaſing thing to him:</hi> And I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, That theſe men may make the <hi>Beſt Harveſt,</hi> with a <hi>Prince</hi> of all others; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if they know skilfully how to Chooſe and Uſe their Times and how to Take in their Sails ſeaſonably before a Storm.</p>

                  <p>Truly one would think that <hi>Love,</hi> which you have Gained by your ſervices, ſhould be <hi>Stable</hi> and <hi>more Firm,</hi> than what comes from <hi>Flattery</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> as ariſing out of an <hi>Honeſt Cauſe;</hi> and which being Cheriſhed in you, is apt to ſtir up others to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as well by <hi>Vertuous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakings.</hi> Yet experience often Teaches us, that very <hi>Great Services</hi> have in <hi>Courts</hi> been the Ruine of thoſe that have Performed them; by reaſon, that <hi>Princes</hi> are wont to <hi>Hate,</hi> whom they cannot <hi>Requite.</hi> They will not be <hi>Indebted</hi> to a <hi>Subject,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do <hi>Fly the Sight</hi> of Thoſe that have Exceeding <hi>well Deſerved of Them,</hi> as if they did with their Looks Reproach them of Ingratitude; which is the Reaſon, why the Condition of ſuch Men in <hi>Courts,</hi> is much to be Pitied; for when they have Obliged the <hi>Prince</hi> by any Service, they are Aſhamed by and by, to <hi>ask a Reward,</hi> leaſt they ſhould ſeem not to have <hi>Given,</hi> but <hi>Sold the Benefit</hi> they did him; who in the mean time, as <hi>Princes</hi> are often <hi>Regardleſs of

                  <p>Which ſome men obſerving, have judged it fit, <hi>to Strike the Iron whilſt it was Hot;</hi> and when they were Deſigned for any <hi>Buſineſs</hi> to Look to their Reward, <hi>before they <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the Imployment;</hi> knowing well that with <hi>Princes</hi> the hope of <hi>Future Services,</hi> is more Prevalent to <hi>Induce Reward,</hi> than the <hi>Memory</hi> of Thoſe that are <hi>Paſt;</hi> and that it is Better to be Obliged to <hi>Princes</hi> than to have them Obliged to us; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe, <hi>Whoever they have Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> do wiſh well to them, whilſt He that they are Indebted unto, becauſe he is Believed not to Love the <hi>Prince</hi> that hath Denied him, what he Pretended unto is Recompenſed onely with <hi>Hate.</hi> This <hi>Commines</hi> tells us, was <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh his Opinion.</p>

                  <p>I Will not Touch here upon <hi>all Pleaſures</hi> whereunto the Nature of the <hi>Prince</hi> is Prone, becauſe All of them are not fit, or apt to have the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of any mans <hi>Fortune</hi> built upon them. Thoſe <hi>Paſſions</hi> that are of greateſt ſway in <hi>Princes</hi> Minds, and familiar unto them, are <hi>three,</hi> to wit, <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Love, Cruelty,</hi> and <hi>Avarice:</hi> The firſt, as it is more Vehement than <hi>All the Reſt,</hi> ſo it is <hi>More <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain,</hi> and <hi>Inconſtant;</hi> for though the <hi>Vice</hi> ſtill remains as to the <hi>Subject,</hi> yet it <hi>keeps not Fixed</hi> ſtill upon the <hi>Same Object:</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, many have uſed this as a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereupon to <hi>Build their Fortunes,</hi> not ſticking to <hi>Proſtitute their Wives,</hi> ſo they might gain <hi>the Favour of the Prince;</hi> as we Read in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that <hi>Otho</hi> did, although it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98923:86"/>ſell not out well with him; for <hi>Nero</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved him from <hi>Court,</hi> leaſt he ſhould have <hi>a Rival</hi> there.</p>
                  <p>Others that they might Bind their <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> unto Them, made themſelves <hi>Witneſſes</hi> and <hi>Companions</hi> of their <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> and <hi>Luſts</hi> by the Example of <hi>Tigellinus.</hi> Theſe Men do not think that <hi>Princes</hi> have a Trick to Free themſelves of <hi>Publique Blame</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> to ſacrifice oftentimes ſuch kind of men unto it. And all thoſe <hi>Servants</hi> of their <hi>Luſts</hi> are to Expect the ſame fortune as hapned to <hi>Remirus de Orco,</hi> the Miniſter of <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> his Cruelties; whom at laſt, <hi>Borgia</hi> cauſed to be Murthered, as Guilty of All the <hi>Ill</hi> that he had done.</p>
                  <p>And from the Example of this <hi>Remirus,</hi> we may alſo Read their Deſtiny, who ſerve the <hi>Prince</hi> in his <hi>Cruelties;</hi> for the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Affection ſeldom endures towards them, both becauſe he doth, as it were, daily read <hi>his Wickedneſs in ſeeing them,</hi> and alſo is <hi>Afraid of them,</hi> whom he knows <hi>ſo Apt to Villainy.

                  <p>The <hi>Affections of Avarice</hi> are leaſt of all changeable; the diverſity of the <hi>Object</hi> doth not vary in theſe as in thoſe of <hi>Love;</hi> it is not <hi>Diminiſhed,</hi> but <hi>Increaſes with Age;</hi> and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98923:86"/>although it is as <hi>Hateful to the People,</hi> as <hi>Cruelty,</hi> yet it is <hi>Longer Endured,</hi> becauſe it <hi>Covers</hi> and <hi>Cloaks all Exactions,</hi> under the pretence of <hi>Publick Neceſſity, Parſimony,</hi> and the <hi>Common good.</hi> Therefore, thoſe that upon this ſcore ſerve <hi>Princes,</hi> may long preſerve themſelves in their <hi>Favour,</hi> whilſt (which is rare in theſe kind of men) they do not become <hi>Froward</hi> and <hi>Peeviſh,</hi> nor too much intend <hi>Enriching Themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Frowardneſs,</hi> which for the moſt part is likewiſe <hi>Contumelious,</hi> begets Hatred both to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and to it ſelf; The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of which, the <hi>Prince</hi> will at laſt caſt away, to Remove the <hi>Envy</hi> of it from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riches</hi> are alſo obnoxious to <hi>Envy,</hi> not of the <hi>People onely,</hi> but ſometimes of the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelf; who if he be <hi>Truly Avaritious,</hi> will hardly be Content, till he have <hi>Squeezed the Full Sponge,</hi> as we read that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was wont to do; but will rather Imitate the <hi>Country Clowns,</hi> who when they have <hi>Fatned their Hogs, do Kill and Devour them.</hi> Truly, <hi>France</hi> hath ſeen many ſuch, who being <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Peeviſh,</hi> and who making too much Haſt to be Rich, have thereby, and by their <hi>Inſolence,</hi> from a great Height of <hi>Fortune,</hi> faln to <hi>Nothing.</hi>

                  <p>In the time of <hi>Philip le Belle, Peter Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> High Chamberlain, and Treaſurer of <hi>France,</hi> was ſtrangled at <hi>Paris; Lewis,

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98923:92"/>Bloud the very Abſtract of all the greateſt Houſes in Chriſtendom; and remarkable it is concerning that violent deſertion of the Royal Houſe of the <hi>Britains,</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and afterwards by the Conqueſt of the <hi>Normans,</hi> that by the viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude of times, and through a diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (almoſt a thouſand years) the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Scepter ſhould fall back into the Current of the old Britiſh bloud, in the perſon of her Renowned Grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, together with whatſoever the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Norman, Burgundian, Caſtalian,</hi> and <hi>Erench</hi> Atchievements, with the Intermarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, which Eight hundred years had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, incorporated, and brought back into the old Royal Line.</p>
                  <p>By her Mother She was of no Soveraign deſcent, yet Noble, and very Ancient in the Name and Family of <hi>Bullen,</hi> though ſome Erroneouſly brand it with a Citizens riſe or original, which was yet but of a ſecond Brother, who (as it were) Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Greatneſs and Luſtre to come to his Houſe, was ſent into the City to acquire wealth, <hi>ad aedificandum antiquam domum.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe atchievements (for he was Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi>) fell in, as it was averred, both the bloud and inheritance of the eldeſt Brother, for want of iſſue Male, by which Accumulation, the Houſe within a few deſcents mounted in <hi>Culmen
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98923:92"/>honoris,</hi> and was ſuddenly Elated into the beſt Families of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as <hi>Howard, Ormund, Sackvile,</hi> and divers others. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus Toucht, and now leaving her Stirp, I come to her Perſon; and as ſhe came to the Crown by the deceaſe of her Brother and Siſter. Under <hi>Edward</hi> She was His, and one of the Darlings of Fortune: for beſides the conſideration of Bloud, there was between theſe two Princes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currency and Symphathy in their Natures and Affections, together with the Celeſtial bond (conformity in Religion) which made them One, and Friends; for the King e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called her his Sweeteſt and Deareſt Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and was ſcarce his own man, She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent, which was not ſo between him and the Lady <hi>Mary.</hi> Under his Siſter She found her condition much altered: For it was reſolved, and her Deſtiny had De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to ſet her an Apprentice in the School of Affliction, and to draw her through the Ordeal fire of tryal, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Mould and Faſhion her to Rule and Sovereignity; which finiſhed, and Fortune calling to mind, that the time of her ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was expired, gave up her Indentures, and therewith delivered up into her cuſtody a Scepter, as a reward for her Patience, which was about the twenty ſixth year of her Age; a time in which (as for Externals) ſhe was full Blown, ſo was ſhe for her Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98923:93"/>grown Ripe and ſeaſoned with Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and in the Exerciſe of her Vertue: for it ſeems Fortune meant no more, than to ſhew her a piece of her variety, and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geableneſs of her Nature, and ſo to conduct her to her deſtined Felicity. She was of Perſonage Tall, of Hair and Complexion Fair, and therewith well favoured, but high noſed, of limbs and feature neat, and which added to the Luſtre of thoſe Exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Graces, of Stately and Majeſtick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; participating in this more of her Father than Mother, who was of an inferiour Allay, Plauſible, or as the French hath it, more <hi>debonaire</hi> and Affable, vertues which might well ſuit with Majeſty; and which deſcending, as Hereditary to the Daughter, did render her of a more ſweet Temper, and Endeared her more to the love and liking of the people; who gave her the name and fame of a moſt Gracious and Popular Princeſs; the atrocity of her Father's nature, being Rebated in hers, by the Mother's ſweeter Inclinations. For to take, and that no more than the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, out of his own mouth; He never ſpared man in his anger, nor woman in his luſt.</p>
                  <p>If we ſearch further into her Intellectuals and abilities, the whole courſe of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment decyphers them to the Admiration of poſterity; for it was full of Magnanimity,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98923:93"/>tempered with Juſtice, and Piety; and to ſpeak truly, noted but with one act or taint; all her deprivations either of life or liberty, being legal, and neceſſitated: She was learned (her ſex, and the time conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) beyond Common belief; for letters about this time, and ſomewhat before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be of Eſteem and in faſhion, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages being overcaſt with the Miſts and Fogs of the <hi>Roman</hi> ignorance; and it was the maxim that over-ruled the foregoing times, That ignorance was the mother of devotion. Her wars were a long time more in the Auxiliary part, in Aſſiſtance of foreign Princes and States, than by Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any, till common policie Adviſed it for a ſafer way, to ſtrike firſt abroad, than at home to Expect the ware, in all which ſhe was happy &amp; victorious. The Change and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Religion upon the Inſtant of her Acceſſion (the ſmoak and fire of her Siſter's Matyrdomes ſcarcely quenched) was none of her leaſt remarkable Accounts: But the ſupport and eſtabliſhment thereof, with the means of her ſubſiſtence, amidſt ſo Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Enemies abroad, and thoſe many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtique Practices, were (methinks) works of Inſpiration, and of no humane providence, which on her Siſter's depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhe moſt religiouſly acknowledged, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the glory of her deliverance to God alone: for ſhe received the news both of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98923:94"/>Queens death, and her Proclamation, by the general Conſent of the Houſe, and the Publick ſuffrage of the people, whereat, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on her knees (after a good time of Reſpiration) ſhe uttered this Verſe of the Pſalms, <hi>A Domino factum eſt iſtud, &amp; eſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile in oculis noſtris,</hi> which we find to this day on the ſtamp of her gold, with this on her ſilver, <hi>Poſui Deum adjutorem meum.</hi> Her Miniſters and Inſtruments of State, ſuch as were <hi>participes curarum,</hi> and bore a great part of the burthen, were Many, and thoſe Memorable, but they were onely Favourites, not Minions; ſuch as Acted more by her own Princely rules and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than by their own wills and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, which ſhe Obſerved to the laſt: for we find no <hi>Gaveſton, Vere,</hi> or <hi>Spencer,</hi> to have ſwayed alone, during forty four years; which was a well ſettled and Adviſed Maxim; for it valued her the more, it Awed the moſt ſecure, and it took beſt with the people, and it ſtarved all Emulations, which are apt to riſe and vent in obloquious acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (even againſt the Prince) where there is onely <hi>Amator Palatii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Principal note of her Reign will be that ſhe ruled much by <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> which her ſelf both made, upheld, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kned, as her own great judgment adviſed. For I diſaſſent from the common received opinion, that my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98923:94"/>and Above all in her <hi>Grace:</hi> and though I come ſomewhat ſhort of the knowledge of thoſe times, yet (that I might not Rove, and ſhoot at Random) I know it from aſſured Intelligence, that it was not ſo. For proof whereof (among many that I could preſent) I will both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a ſhort, and therein a known truth, And it was thus. <hi>Bowyer,</hi> a Gentleman of the Black rod, being charged by her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command to look Preciſely to all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions into the <hi>Privy-Chamber,</hi> one day ſtayed a very Gay Captain, and a follower of my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s, from Entrance: For that he was neither well known, nor a Sworn Servant to the <hi>Queen:</hi> at which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, the Gentleman bearing high on my Lord's favour, told him, he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance procure him a Diſcharge: <hi>Leiceſter</hi> coming into the Conteſt, ſaid Publickly (which was none of his wont) that he was a Knave, and ſhould not continue long in his Office; and ſo turning about to go in to the Queen, <hi>Bowyer</hi> (who was a bold Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and well beloved) ſtept before him, and fell at her Majeſties feet, Related the ſtory, and humbly craves her Grace's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and whether my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was King, or her Majeſty Queen? Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhe replyed with her wonted Oath (God's death) <hi>my Lord, I have wiſht you well, but my favour is not ſo lockt up for you, that others
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98923:95"/>ſhall not partake thereof; for I have Many Servants, unto whom I have, and will at my Pleaſure bequeath my Favour, and likewiſe Reſume the ſame; and if you think to Rule here I will take a Courſe to ſee you forth Coming, I will have here but one Mistreſs, and no Maſter, and look that no ill happen to Him, leſt it be ſeverely Required at your hands.</hi> Which ſo quelled my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> that his Feigned Humility was long after one of his beſt vertues. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Earl of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> then Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, was his profeſt Antagoniſt to his dying day. And for my Lord of <hi>Hunſdon</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Sackvile,</hi> after Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, (who were all Contemporaties) he was wont to ſay of them, that they were of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> and were <hi>Noli me tangere's;</hi> Implying, that they were not to be Conteſted with; for they were indeed of the Queen's near kindred. From whence, and in more inſtances I Conclude, that ſhe was Abſolute and Soveraign Miſtreſs of her Graces; and that all thoſe, to whom ſhe diſtributed her Favours, were never more than Tenants at will and ſtood on no better ground than her Princely Pleaſure and their own Good behaviour. And this alſo I preſent as a known Obſervation, that ſhe was (though very capable of Counſel) abſolute enough in her own Reſolutions; which was ever Apparent even to her laſt, in that her
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98923:95"/>Averſation to grant <hi>Tirone</hi> the leaſt drop of her Mercy, though Earneſtly and Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Importuned by the whole Councel of State, with very many Preſſing Reaſons, and as the ſtate of her Kingdom then ſtood (I may ſpeak it with Aſſurance) Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated Arguments. If we look into her Inclination, as it is diſpoſed either to <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence</hi> or <hi>Frugality,</hi> we ſhall find in them many Notable Conſiderations, for all her Diſpenſations were ſo poyſed, as though Diſcretion and Juſtice had both agreed to ſtand at the beam, and ſee them weighed out in due Proportion, the Maturity of her Years and Judgment meeting in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currency, and at ſuch an Age as ſeldom lapſeth to Exceſs. To conſider them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: We have not many Precedents of her Liberality, or of any large Donatives to particular men; my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Book of <hi>Parks</hi> only Excepted, which was a Princely gift, and ſome few more of a leſſer Size to my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter, Hatton,</hi> and others. Her Rewards conſiſted chiefly in Grants of Leaſes of Offices, Places of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but for Ready Money, and in any Great ſums, ſhe was very ſparing; which we partly conceive was a Vertue rather drawn from Neceſſity, than her Nature, for ſhe had many layings out, and to her laſt Period. And I am of opinion with S. <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> that thoſe many Brave Men of our Times, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98923:96"/>of the <hi>Militia,</hi> Taſted little more of her Bounty than in her Grace and Good word, with their due Entertainment, for She ever paid the <hi>Souldiers</hi> well, which was the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of her Times, and more than her Great Adverſary of <hi>Spain</hi> could Perform. So that when we come to the conſideration of her <hi>Frugality,</hi> the obſervation will be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more, than that her <hi>Bounty</hi> and it were ſo Inter-woven together, that the one was ſuited by an honourable way of Spending, the other limited by a Neceſſitated way of Sparing. The Iriſh Action we may call a malady, and a Conſumption of her Times, for it Accompanied her to her End; and it was of ſo Profuſe and vaſt an Expence, that it drew near a diſtemperature of State, and of Paſſion in her ſelf: For toward her laſt ſhe grew Hard to Pleaſe; her Arms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Accuſtomed to proſperity, and the Iriſh proſecution not anſwering her Expectation and wonted ſucceſs for a good while, it was an Unthrifty and Inauſpicious war, which did much diſturb and Miſlead her judgment, &amp; the more for that it was a Precedent which was taken out of her own pattern: For as the Queen (by way of diverſion) had at the coming to the Crown ſupported the revolted States of <hi>Holland,</hi> ſo did the King of <hi>Spain</hi> turn the Trick on her ſelf towards her going out, by cheriſhing the Iriſh rebellion. Where it falls into conſideration, what the State of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98923:96"/>Kingdom and the Crown Revenues were then able to Embrace and Endure; if we look into the Eſtabliſhment of thoſe times, with the liſt of the Iriſh Army, conſidering the defeatments of <hi>Blackwater,</hi> with all prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Expences, as it ſtood from my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s undertaking to the ſurrender of <hi>Kingſale</hi> under the General <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> and ſomewhat after; we ſhall find the Horſe and Foot Troops were for three or four years together, much about 20000. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Naval charge, which was a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of the ſame War, in that the Queen was then forced to keep in continual pay a ſtrong Fleet at Sea, to Attend the Spaniſh Coaſts and Ports, both to alarm the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> and to intercept his Forces deſigned for the Iriſh aſſiſtance: ſo that the charge of that War alone did coſt the Queen 300000 l. <hi>per annum</hi> at leaſt, which was not the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of her Disburſements, an Expence which (without the publick ſaid) the State and the Royal Receipts could not have much longer endured; which out of her own frequent Letters and complaints to the Deputy <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> for caſheering part of that Liſt as ſoon as he could, may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; for the Queen was then driven into a ſtrait.</p>
                  <p>We are naturally prone to Applaud the Times behind us, and to vilifie the preſent: for the current of her Fame carries it to this
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98923:97"/>day, how Royally and Victoriouſly ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and dyed, without the grievance and grudge of the people; yet that truth may appear without retraction from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſo great a Princeſs, it is manifeſt ſhe left more debts unpaid, taken upon the credit of her Privy Seals, than her Progenitors did, or could have taken up that way, in a hundred years before her; which was an enforced piece of State, to lay the burthen on that horſe, that was beſt able to bear it, at the dead lift, when neither her Receipts could yield her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief at the pinch, nor the urgency of her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs endure the delays of a Parliamentary Aſſiſtance: And for ſuch aids it is likewiſe apparent, That ſhe received more, and with the love of the people, than any two of her Predeceſſors, that took moſt; which was a Fortune ſtrained out of the Subject, through the Plauſibility of her Comportment, and, as I would ſay without offence, the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Diſtribution of her Graces to all ſorts of Subjects: For I believe, no Prince living, that was ſo Tender of Honour, and ſo exactly ſtood for the preſervation of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, that was ſo great a Courtier of her people, yea, of the Commons, and that Stoopt and Deſcended lower in preſenting her perſon to the publick view, as ſhe paſt in her Progreſſes and Perambulations; and in the Ejaculation of her prayers on her people.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98923:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>And truly, though much may be given in praiſe of her Magnanimity, and therewith comply with her Parliaments, and for all that come off at laſt with honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; yet muſt we aſcribe ſome part of the Commendation to the wiſdom of the times, and the choice of Parliament-men: for I find not that they were at any time given to any violent or pertinacious diſpute, Elections being made of <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Diſcreet</hi> perſons, not <hi>Factious</hi> and <hi>Ambitious</hi> of Fame; ſuch as came not to the Houſe with a Malevolent ſpirit of Contention, but with a Preparation to Conſult on the Publick Good, rather to Comply than Conteſt with her Majeſty: Neither doe I find, that the Houſe was at any time weakned and peſtered with the admiſſion of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Young heads,</hi> as it hath been of later times; which remembers me of Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Martin</hi>'s Speech, about the tenth of our late Soveraign Lord King <hi>James,</hi> when there were Accounts taken of forty Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, not above Twenty, and ſome not exceeding Sixteen, which moved him to ſay, That it was the Ancient cuſtom for Old men to make Laws for young ones, but that then he ſaw the caſe altered, and that there were Children Elected unto the great Council of the Kingdom which came to invade and invert nature, and to Enact Laws to Govern their Fathers. Sure we are,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98923:98"/>the Houſe always took the <hi>Common Cauſe</hi> into their Conſideration, and they ſaw the Queen had juſt occaſion, and need e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to uſe their Aſſiſtance; neither do I remember that the Houſe did ever Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate or Preferr their Private to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, the Queen's neceſſities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but waited their times, and in the firſt place gave their Supply, and according to the Exigency of her Affairs; yet failed not at laſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what they deſired, ſo that the Queen and her Parliaments had ever the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to depart in love, and on reciprocal Terms, which are conſiderations which have not been ſo Exactly obſerved in our laſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, as they might, and I would to God they had been: for conſidering the great debt left on the King, and in what Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances the Houſe it ſelf had then Drawn him, his Majeſty was not well uſed, though I lay not the blame on the whole ſuffrage of the Houſe, where he had Many good Friends; for I dare Avouch, had the Houſe been freed of half a dozen of <hi>Popular</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Perſons,</hi> ſuch as (with the fellow that burnt the Temple at <hi>Epheſus</hi>) would be talked of, though but for Doing of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, I am confident the King had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that which in Reaſon, and at his firſt Acceſſion, he ought to have Received Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without any Condition. But par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Digreſſion, which is here Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98923:98"/>not in the way of Aggravation, but in true zeal to the publick good, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in <hi>Caution</hi> to future times; for I am not Ignorant how the ſpirit of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom now moves to make his Majeſty A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends on any occaſion, and how deſirous the Subject is to Expiate that offence at any Rate, may it pleaſe his Majeſty graciouſly to make tryal of his Subjects Affection, and at what price they now value his Goodneſs and Magnanimity. But to our purpoſe; the <hi>Queen</hi> was not to learn, that as the ſtrength of her Kingdom conſiſted in the Multitude of her Subjects; ſo the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her Perſon Reſted in the Love and Fidelity of her people; which ſhe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litickly Affected (as it hath been thought) ſomewhat beneath the Height of her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Natural Magnanimity. Moreover it will be a true note of her Providence, that ſhe would always liſten to her Profit, for ſhe would not refuſe the Informations of Mean Perſons, with purpoſed improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and had learned the Philoſophy of <hi>Hoc agere,</hi> to look into her own work; of the which there is a notable Example of one <hi>Carwarden,</hi> an under-Officer of the Cuſtom-Houſe, who obſerving his time, preſented her with a paper, ſhewing how ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed in the under-renting of her Cuſtoms, and therewithall humbly deſired her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to Conceal Him, for that it did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98923:99"/>two or three of her great Councellours whom Cuſtomer <hi>Smith</hi> had Bribed with 200l. a man, ſo to loſe the Queen 200 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> which being made known to the Lords, they gave ſtrict order, that <hi>Carwarden</hi> ſhould not have Acceſs to the back-ſtairs; till at laſt, her Majeſty Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Craft, and Miſſing <hi>Carwarden,</hi> She ſent for him back, and incouraged him to ſtand to his Information; which the poor man did ſo Handſomely, that within the ſpace of ten years, he brought <hi>Smith</hi> to Double his Rent, or to leave the cuſtoms to new Farmers. So that we may take this alſo into obſervation; that there were of the Queen's Council, that were not in the Catalogue of Saints.</p>
                  <p>Now as we have taken a view of ſome particular Notions of her Times, her Nature and Neceſſities: It is not beſide the text, to give a ſhort Touch on the Helps, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of her Reign, which were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Parallel, for ſhe had neither <hi>Husband, Brother, Siſter,</hi> nor <hi>Children</hi> to Provide for, who as they are Dependants of the Crown, ſo doe they Neceſſarily draw main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from thence, and do oftentimes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt and Draw deep, eſpecially when there is an ample fraternity of the bloud Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and of the Princes of the Bloud, as it was in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth: for when the Crown cannot, the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98923:99"/>Publick ought to give them Honourable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance; for they are the Honour and Hopes of the Kingdom and the Publick, which enjoys them, hath a like intereſt in them with the Father that begot them and our Common-Law, which is the Inheritance of the Kingdom, did ever of old provide aids for the <hi>Primogenitures,</hi> and the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Daughter. So that the multiplicy of Courts, and the Great Charge which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow a King, and Queen, a Prince and the Royal Iſſue, was a thing which was not <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> during the ſpace of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, and which by time was worn out of memory, and without the conſideration of the preſent times. Inſomuch, that the aids given to the late and right noble Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and to his Siſter the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were at firſt generally received for impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a new Coynage. Yea, the late impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Knighthood (though an ancient Law) fell alſo into the imputation of a Tax of novelty, for that it lay long co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the embers of diviſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and forgotten, or connived at by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Princes: So that the ſtrangeneſs of the obſervation, and difference of thoſe later reigns is, that the Queen took up beyond the power of the Law, which fell not into the murmur of the people; and her ſucceſſors no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by warrant of the Law, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98923:100"/>was conceived (through diſuſe) to be Injurious to the Liberty of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Now before I come to any further menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Favourites, (for hitherto I have delivered but ſome Obvious Paſſages, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to prepare and ſmooth a way for the reſt that follows) it is requiſite that I Touch on the Relicks of the other Reign, I mean the Body of her Siſters Council of State, which ſhe Retained intire; neither Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, nor Diſcontenting any, although ſhe knew them averſe to her Religion (and in her Siſters time Perverſe towards her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) and privy to her Troubles and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment; A prudence which was incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible with her Siſters nature, for ſhe both diſſipated and Perſecuted the major part of her Brother's Council. But this will be of certainty, that how Compliable ſoever and Obſequious ſhe found them, yet for a good ſpace ſhe made little uſe of their Counſels, more than in the Ordinary courſe of the Board, for ſhe held a Dormant Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in her own Princely Breaſt: yet ſhe kept them together, and their Places, without any ſudden Change: ſo that we may ſay of them, That they were of the <hi>Court,</hi> not of the <hi>Council.</hi> For whileſt ſhe Amuſed them with a kind of Promiſſive Diſputation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Points Controverted by both Churches, ſhe did ſet down her own Reſervations, without their Privity, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98923:100"/>made all her Progreſſions Gradations. But ſo, that the Tenents of her ſecrecy, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of her eſtabliſhment, were Pitcht, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was known where the Court would ſit down. Neither do I find, that any of her Siſters Council of State were either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to her Religion, or Oppoſed her doings (<hi>Englefield</hi> Maſter of the Horſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, who withdrew himſelf from the Board, and ſhortly after from out her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions) ſo Plyable and Obedient they were to Change with the Times, and their Princes. And of this there will fall in here a Relation both of Recreation, and of known Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paulet,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and Lord Treaſurer, having ſerved then four Princes in as Various and Changeable ſeaſons, that I may well ſay, time, nor any age hath yielded the like precedent. This Man being noted to grow High in her Favour (as his Place and Experience required) was queſtioned by an Intimate friend of his, how he ſtood up for Thirty years together, amidſt the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Reigns of ſo many Chancellors and Great Perſonages; Why, quoth the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, <hi>Ortus ſum ex ſalice, non ex quercu,</hi> I was made of the plyable Willow, not of the ſtubborn Oak. And truly the Old Man hath Taught them all, eſpecially <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke;</hi> for they two were ever of the King's Religion, and over-zealous
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98923:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>profeſſors. Of theſe it is ſaid, that being both younger Brothers (yet of Noble Houſes) they ſpent what was left them, and came on truſt to the Court; where upon the bare ſtock of their Wits they began to Traffick for themſelves, and proſpered ſo well, that they Got, Spent, and Left more than any Subjects from the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt to their own Times: whereunto it hath been prettily replyed, that they lived in a Time of Diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then, of any of the former reign, it is ſaid, that theſe two lived and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly in her favour. The latter, upon his ſon's marriage with the Lady <hi>Katharine Grey,</hi> was like utterly to have loſt himſelf: But at the Inſtant of the conſummation, Apprehending the inſafety and danger of an inter-marriage with the Bloud-Royal, he fell at the Queen's feet, where he both Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his Preſumption with tears, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Cauſe and the Divorce together; and ſo quick he was at his work, (for it ſtood him upon) that upon Repudiation of the Lady, he clapt up a marriage for his Son the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> with <hi>Mary Sidney,</hi> daughter to Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> then Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland;</hi> the blow falling on <hi>Edward</hi> late Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> who to his coſt took up the Divorced Lady, of whom the Lord <hi>Beauchamp</hi> was born, and <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford</hi> is deſcended. I come now
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98923:101"/>to preſent Thoſe of her own Election, which ſhe either admitted to her ſecrets of State, or took into her Grace and Favour: of whom, in their order, I crave leave to give unto poſterity a cautious deſcription, with a ſhort Character or Draught of the perſons themſelves. For without offence to others, I would be true to my ſelf, their memories and merits diſtinguiſhing them of the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> from the <hi>Togati:</hi> and of theſe ſhe had as many, and thoſe as able Miniſters, as any of her Progenitors.</p>

                  <p>IT will be out of doubt, that my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was one of the firſt whom ſhe made Maſter of the Horſe: he was the youngeſt Son then living of the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> beheaded <hi>primo Mariae;</hi> and his Father was that <hi>Dudley,</hi> which our Hiſtories couple with <hi>Epſon;</hi> and both ſo much Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the Caterpillars of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, during the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh; who being of a Noble extract, was Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: but not thereby ſo Extinct, but that he left a plentiful Eſtate, and ſuch a Son, who, as the vulgar ſpeaks it, could live without the Seat; for out of the aſhes of his Father's Infamy, he
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98923:102"/>roſe to be a Duke, and as High, as ſubjection could Permit, or Soveraignty endure; and though he could not find out any Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to aſſume the Crown in his own Perſon, yet he projected, and very nearly Effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for his Son <hi>Gilbert,</hi> by Inter-marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the Lady <hi>Jane Gray,</hi> and ſo by that way to bring it about into his loyns. Obſervations, which though they lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us, and ſeem impertinent to the Text, yet are they not much Extravagant: for they muſt lead, and ſhew us how the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-paſſages were brought about with the Dependances; and on the hinges of a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral workmanſhip: and truly, it may amaze a well-ſetled judgment, to look back into thoſe times, and to conſider how this Duke could attain to ſuch a pitch of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; his Father dying in Ignominy, and at the Gallows, his Eſtate confiſcate, and that for Peeling and Polling, by the Clamour, and Crucifige of the People; but when we better think upon it, we find that he was given up, but as a Sacrifice to pleaſe the People, not for any offence committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Perſon of the King; ſo that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter he was a Martyr of the Prerogative, and the King in honour could do no leſs, than give back to his Son the Privileges of his blood, with the acquirings of his Father's profeſſion, for he was a Lawyer, and of the King's
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98923:102"/>Counſel at Law, before he came to be <hi>ex interioribus conſiliis,</hi> where, beſides the lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own fingers, he got the King a maſs of Riches, and that not with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, but the loſs of his fame and life for the King's Father's ſake. Certain it is, that his Son was left rich in Purſe and Brain, which are good foundations, and full to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; and it may be ſuppoſed, he was on all occaſions well heard of the King, as a Perſon of mark and compaſſion in his eye: but I find not that he did put up for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, during <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, although a vaſt Aſpirer, and Provident ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. It ſeems he thought the King's reign was given to the falling ſickneſs: but eſpying his time fitting, and the Soveraignty in the hands of a Pupil Prince, he thought he might as well then put-up for it as the beſt, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then poſſeſſion of blood, and a purſe, with a head-piece of a vaſt extent, he ſoon got Honour, and no ſooner there, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſide it with the beſt, even with the Protector, and in concluſion got his, and his Brother's heads; ſtill aſpiring, till he Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired in the loſs of his own: ſo that Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may, by Reading the Father and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, make judgment of the Son; for we ſhall find, that this <hi>Robert</hi> (whoſe ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal we have now traced, the better to preſent him) was inheritor of the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us and Craft of his Father, and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98923:103"/>the eſtate, of whom hereafter we ſhall make ſome ſhort mention.</p>
                  <p>We take him now as he was admitted into the Court, and the Queen's favour, where he was not to ſeek to play his part well, and dexterouſly. But his play was chiefly at the fore game; not that he was a learner at the latter, but he loved not the after-wit, for they report (and I think not untruly) that he was ſeldom behind-hand with his Gameſters, and that they always went away with the loſs.</p>
                  <p>He was a very Goodly Perſon, and ſingular well-Featured, and all his youth well Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and of a Sweet aſpect, but High-fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, which as I ſhould take it, was of no Diſcommendation: but towards his latter end (which with old Men, was but a middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age) he grew High-coloured and Red-faced. So that the Queen in this, had much of Her Father, for (excepting ſome of Her Kindred, and ſome few that had handſom wits in crooked bodies) ſhe always took Perſonage in the way of her election; for the people hath it to this day in Proverb, King <hi>Harry</hi> loved a Man.

                  <p>We muſt now take (and that of truth, into obſervation, That until the 10th of her Reign
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98923:106"/>her Times were Calm and Serene, though ſometimes a little over-caſt, as the moſt Glorious Sun-riſings are ſubject to ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and droppings. For the Clouds of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Vapours of the Holy League, began then to Diſperſe and Threaten her Serenity; Moreover, ſhe was then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt ſome Inteſtine Storms, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to gather in the very heart of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; all which had a Relation and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency each with other, to Dethrone her, and to Diſturb the publick Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therewithal (as a principal work) the Eſtabliſhed Religion; for the name of Recuſant began then, and firſt to be known to the World, and till then the Catholicks were no more than Church-Papiſts; but were commanded by the Pope's Expreſs Letters to Appear, and Forbear Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, as they tender their Holy Father, and the Holy Catholick Church their Mother: ſo that it ſeems the Pope had then his Times to take a true Muſter of his Children; but the Queen had the greater Advantage, for ſhe likewiſe took Tale of her Apoſtate Subjects, their Strength, and how many they were that had given up their Names unto <hi>Baal.</hi> He then by the Hands of ſome of his Proſelytes, fixed his <hi>Bulls</hi> on the Gates of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, which Diſcharged her Subjects of all fidelity, and laid ſiege to the received Faith, and ſo under the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98923:106"/>veil of the next Succeſſor, to Replant the Catholick Religion; ſo that the Queen had then a new Task and Work in hand, that might well awake her beſt Providence, and required a Meſter of Men and Arms, as well as Courtſhips and Councels; for the Times began to be Quick and Active, and fitter for ſtronger Motions, than thoſe of the Carpet; and it will be a true note of her Magnanimity, that ſhe loved a Souldier, and had a Propenſion in her nature to Regard, and always to Grace them: which the Courtiers taking into obſervation, took it as an invitation to win Honour, together with her Majeſties Favour, by expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Wars; eſpecially, when the Queens and the Affairs of the Kingdom ſtood in ſome Neceſſity of a Souldier: For we have many inſtances of the Sallies of the Nobility and Gentry; yea, and out of the Court, and her Privy Favourites (that had any touch or tincture of <hi>Mars</hi> in their inclinations) and to ſteal away without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and the Queen's privity, which had like to have coſt ſome of them dear; ſo predominant were their Thoughts and Hopes of Honour growing in them; as we may truly obſerve in the diſpoſitions of Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Eſſex, Mountjoy,</hi> and divers others, whoſe Abſence, and the Manner of their Eruptions was very Diſtaſtful to her: whereof I can here add
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98923:107"/>a True, and no Impertinent Story, and that of the laſt <hi>Mountjoy;</hi> who having twice or thrice ſtoln away into <hi>Britain</hi> (where under Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> he had then a Company) without the Queen's leave and privity; ſhe ſent a Meſſenger unto him, with a ſtrict charge to the General to ſee him ſent home: when he came into the Queen's Preſence, ſhe fell into a kind of Reviling, Demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how he durſt go over without her leave; Serve me ſo (quoth ſhe) once more, and I will lay you Faſt enough for Running; You will never leave it until you are knockt on the head, as that inconſiderate Fellow <hi>Sidney</hi> was; You ſhall Go when I ſend you, in the mean Time ſee that you lodge in the Court (which was then at <hi>White-Hall</hi>) where you may follow your Book, Read and Diſcourſe of the Wars.</p>
                  <p>But to our purpoſe: It fell out happily to Thoſe, and (as I may ſay) to Thoſe Times, That the Queen, during the Calm of her Reign, was not idle, nor rockt aſleep with Security; for ſhe had been very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in the Reparation and Augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Shipping and Ammunition: and I know not whether by a fore-ſight of <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> or an <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> it came about, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was an Act of her Compaſſion; but it is moſt certain, That ſhe ſent Levies, and no ſmall Troops to the aſſiſtance of the Revolted States of <hi>Holland,</hi> before ſhe had
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98923:107"/>received any Affront from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that might Deſerve, or Tend to a breach in Hoſtility; which the Papiſts to this day Maintain, was the Provocation and Cauſe of the after-wars: but omitting what might be ſaid to this point, thoſe Netherland wars were the King's Seminaries, and the Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of very many Brave Souldiers; and ſo were likewiſe the Civil Wars of <hi>France</hi> (whither ſhe ſent five ſeveral Armies) the French-Schools that inured the Youth and Gallantry of the Kingdom, and it was a <hi>Militia</hi> wherein they were daily in acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the diſcipline of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were then turned the Queen's Invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enemies.</p>
                  <p>And this have I taken into obſervation of her <hi>Dies Halcyonii,</hi> thoſe years of hers which were more Serene and Quiet than thoſe that followed; which though they were not leſs propitious, as being Touched more with the point of Honour and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet were they Troubled, and ever Cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over both with Domeſtick and Foreign Machinations; and it is already quoted, they were ſuch as awakened her Spirits, and made her caſt about how to Defend, rather by Offending, and by the way of diverting to Prevent all Invaſions, than to Expect them, which was a piece of Policy of the times: and with this I have noted the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or <hi>Principia</hi> of the Wars following,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98923:108"/>and likewiſe pointed to the Seed-plots from whence ſhe took up thoſe Brave Men, and Plants of Honour, which Acted on the Theatre of <hi>Mars,</hi> and on whom ſhe diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Rayes of her Grace, which were Perſons in their kinds of Rare Vertues, and ſuch as might (out of height of Merit) pretend intereſt to her Favour; of which rank, the number will equal, if not exceed that of the Gown-men.

                  <p>SIr <hi>Francis Walſingham</hi> (as we have ſaid) had the honour to be Sir <hi>Philip Sidney's</hi> Father in Law: He was a Gentleman (at firſt) of a Good Houſe, but of better Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and from the Univerſity Travelled for the reſt of his Learning. He was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Beſt Linguiſt of the times, but knew beſt how to uſe his own Tongue, whereby he came to be employed in the Chiefeſt Affairs of State. He was ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour into <hi>France,</hi> and ſtayed there a <hi>Leiger</hi> long, in the heat of the Civil wars, and at the ſame time that Mounſieur was here a Suitor to the Queen; and if I be not miſtaken, he played the very ſame part there, as ſince <hi>Gundamore</hi> did here: At his
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98923:109"/>return, he was taken Principal Secretary, and was one of the Great Engines of State, and of the times, high in the Queen's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and a watchful ſervant over the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>They note him to have had certain Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities, and Secret ways of Intelligence above the reſt: But I muſt confeſs I am to ſeek wherefore he ſuffered <hi>Parry</hi> to play ſo long on the hook, before he hoyſed him up; and I have been a little curious in the ſearch thereof, though I have not to do with the <hi>Arcana Imperii.</hi> For to know is ſometimes a burthen; and I remember that it was <hi>Ovid's crimen aut error,</hi> That he ſaw too much.

                  <p>There were about theſe times two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals in the Queen's favour; Old Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Knowls</hi> Comptroller of the Houſe, and Sir <hi>Henry Norris,</hi> whom ſhe called up at a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to ſit with the Peers in the higher Houſe, as Lord <hi>Norris</hi> of <hi>Ricot,</hi> who had married the daughter and heir of the old Lord <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Tame,</hi> a Noble perſon, and to whom in the Queen's adverſity ſhe had been committed to ſafe cuſtody, and from him had received more than ordinary obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.

                  <p>SIr <hi>Francis Knowls</hi> was ſomewhat of the Queen's affinity, and had likwiſe no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Iſſue; for he had alſo <hi>William</hi> his eldeſt, and ſince Earl of <hi>Banbury,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis;</hi> if I be not a little miſtaken in their names and marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling; and there was alſo the Lady <hi>Lettice,</hi> a Siſter, of theſe, who was firſt Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and after of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> And theſe were alſo brave men in their times and places; but they were of the Court, and Carpet, not led by the genius of the Camp.</p>
                  <p>Between theſe two Families, there was (as it falleth out amongſt Great ones, and Competitors for favour) no great correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: and there were ſome ſeeds, either of emulation or diſtruſt caſt between them, which had they not been disjoyned in the reſidence of their perſons, (as it was the fortune of their imployments, the one ſide attending the Court, the other the Pavilion) ſurely they would have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out into ſome kind of hoſtility, or at leaſt they would have wreſtled one in the other, like Trees incircled with Ivy:
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98923:113"/>For there was a time when (both theſe Fraternities being met at Court) there paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a challenge between them at certain exerciſes, the Queen and the old men being ſpectators, which ended in a flat quarrel amongſt them all. And I am perſwaded (though I ought not to judge) that there were ſome reliques of this feud, that were long after the cauſes of the one Families (almoſt utter) extirpation, and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers improſperity. For it was a known truth, that ſo long as my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> lived, who was the main pillar of the one ſide, as having married the Siſter, none of the other ſide took any deep rooting in the Court, though otherwiſe they made their ways to Honour by their ſwords: And that which is of more note, (conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s uſe of Men of Arms, being ſhortly after ſent Governour to the Revolted States, and no Souldier himſelf) is, that he made no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> a Soldier then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly famouſed, and trained from a Page, under the diſcipline of the great Captain of Chriſtendom, the Admiral <hi>Caſtilion,</hi> and of Command in the French and Dutch wars almoſt twenty years.

                  <p>SIr <hi>John Perrot</hi> was a goodly Gentleman, and of the Sword: And as he was of a very ancient deſcent, as an heir to many abſtracts of Gentry, eſpecially from <hi>Guy de
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98923:114"/>Bryan</hi> of <hi>Lawhern,</hi> ſo was he of a vaſt Eſtate, and came not to the Court for want. And to theſe adjuncts, he had the endowments of courage, and height of ſpirit, had it lighted on the allay of temper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; the defect whereof, with a native freedom and boldneſs of ſpeech, drew him on to a clouded ſetting, and laid him open to the ſpleen and advantage of his enemies, amongſt whom Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi> was profeſt. He was yet a wiſe man, and a brave Courtier; but rough, and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more of active than ſedentary motions, as being in his conſtellation deſtinated for Arms. There is a quaere of ſome denota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how he came to receive his foyl, and that in the Cataſtrophe; for he was ſtrengthened with honourable Alliances, and the privy friendſhips of the Court; My Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Burleigh,</hi> both his Contemporaries, and Familiars; but that there might be (as the Adage hath it) falſity in friendſhip; and we may reſt fatisfied, that there is no diſputing againſt fate.</p>
                  <p>They quote him for a perſon that loved to ſtand too much alone, and on his own legs, of too often receſſes, and diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance from the Queen's preſence: A fault which is incompatible with the ways of Court and favour,</p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:98923:114"/>
                  <p>He was ſent Lord Deputy into <hi>Ireland,</hi> (as it was thought) for a kind of haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of ſpirit; and repugnancy in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels; or as others have thought, the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Perſon then to bridle the inſolency of the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> And probable it is, that both theſe (conſidering the ſway that he would have at the Board, and head in the Queen's favour) concurred, and did a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire his remove, and his ruine: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland</hi> he went, where he did the Queen very great and many ſervices, if the ſurpluſſage of the meaſure did not abate the value of the merit; as aftertimes found that to be no paradox: For to ſave the Queen's purſe, (which both her ſelf, and my Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> ever took for good ſervices) he impoſed on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> the charge of bearing their own arms; which both gave them the poſſeſſion, and taught them the uſe of weapons; which proved in the end a moſt fatal work, both in the profuſion of blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>But at his return, and on ſome account ſent home before touching the ſtate of the Kingdom, the aſſiduous teſtimonies of her grace were towards him; till by his retreat to his Caſtle at <hi>Cary,</hi> where he was then building, and out of deſire to be in command at home, (as he had been abroad together with the hatred and practice of <hi>Hatton,</hi> then
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98923:115"/>in high favour, whom not long before he had too bitterly taunted for his Dancing. He was accuſed of High Treaſon, and for high Words, and a forged Letter, Condemned; though the Queen, on the News of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, Swore by her wonted Oath, That they were all Knaves. And they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with aſſurance, That on his return to the Tower, after his Trial, he ſaid in Oaths, and in Fury, to the Lieutenant Sir <hi>Owen Hopton,</hi> What, will the Queen ſuffer her Brother to be offered up as a Sacrifice to the Envy of my Frisking Adverſaries? Which being made known to the Queen, and the Warrant for his Execution tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſomewhat enforced; ſhe refuſed to Sign it, and Swore he ſhould not die, for he was an honeſt &amp; a faithful Man. And ſurely, though not altogether to ſet up our reſt and faith upon Tradition, and upon old Reports, as that Sir <hi>Thomas Perrot</hi> his Father was a Gentleman of the Privy-Chamber to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and in the Court married a Lady of Great Honour, of the King's Familiarity, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions of ſome implication: But if we go a little further, and compare his Picture, his Qualities, Geſture, and Voice, with that of the King's, which memory retains yet amongſt us, they will plead ſtrongly, that he was a Subreptitious Child of the Blood Royal.</p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:98923:115"/>
                  <p>Certain it is, that he lived not long in the Tower; and that after his deceaſe, Sir <hi>Thomas Perrot</hi> his Son (then of no mean eſteem with the Queen) having before married my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Siſter, ſince Counteſs of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> had reſtitution of all his Lands; though after his deceaſe alſo (which immediately followed) the Crown reſumed his Eſtate, and took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the former Attainder. And to ſay the truth, the Prieſt's Forged Letter was, at his Arraignment, thought but a Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Envy, and was ſoon after exploded by the Prieſt's own confeſſion. But that which moſt exaſperated the Queen, and gave advantage to his Enemies, was (as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> takes into his obſervation) words of diſdain. For the Queen, by ſharp and reprehenſive Letters, had netled him; and ſhortly after ſending others of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, commending his Service, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating an Invaſion from <hi>Spain;</hi> which he no ſooner peruſed, but he ſaid publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Great Chamber at <hi>Dublin;</hi> Lo, now ſhe is ready to Piſs her ſelf for fear of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> I am again one of her White-boys.</p>
                  <p>Words which are ſubject to a various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and tended to ſome diſreputation of his Soveraign: and ſuch as may ſerve for inſtruction to perſons in place of honor and command, to beware of the violences of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98923:116"/>nature, but eſpecially of the exorbitances of the tongue. And ſo I conclude him with this double obſervation, The one of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of his intentions, exempt and clear from the guilt of treaſon and diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; The other, of the greatneſs of his heart: For at his arraignment, he was ſo little dejected by what might be alledged and proved againſt him, that he rather grew troubled with choler, and in a kind of exaſperation deſpiſed his Jury, though of the Order of Knighthood, and of the ſpecial Gentry, claiming the privilege of trial by the Peers and Baronage of the Realm: ſo prevalent was that of his native Genius, and the hautineſs of his ſpirit, which accompanied him to his laſt, and till (without any diminution of courage) it brake in pieces the cords of his magnanimity, for he died ſuddenly in the Tower, and when it was thought the Queen did intend his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment, with the reſtitution of his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which were then very great, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to moſt of the Nobility.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98923:117"/>grace from him, and drew others together with the Admiral to a combination, and to conſpire his ruine. And though I have heard it from that party, (I mean of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals faction) that it lay not in his proper power to hurt my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> yet he had more Followers, and ſuch as were well skilled in ſetting of the Gyn. But I leave this to thoſe of another Age.</p>
                  <p>It is out of doubt, that the Admiral was a good, honeſt, and a brave Man, and a faithful ſervant to his Miſtriſs, and ſuch a one as the Queen, out of her own Princely Judgment, knew to be a fit Inſtrument for that ſervice, for ſhe was no ill Proficient in the Reading of Men, as well as Books; and his ſundry expeditions, as that afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and 88. doth both expreſs his worth, and manifeſt the Queen's Truſt, and the opinion ſhe had of his Fidelity and Conduct.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the <hi>Howards</hi> were of the Queen's Alliance, and Conſanguinity by her Mother, which ſwayed her Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bent it toward this Great Houſe; and it was a part of her Natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, to Grace and Support An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Nobility, where it did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench, neither invade her Intereſt; for on ſuch treſpaſſes ſhe was quick and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and would not ſpare any whatſoever;

And whether <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> had then caſt in a good word for him to the Queen, which would have done no harm, I do not determine: But true it is, He had gotten the Queen's ear at a trice, and ſhe began to be taken with his elocution, and loved to hear his reaſons to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: and the truth is, ſhe took him for a kind of Oracle, which netled them all; yea, thoſe that he relied on, began to take his ſudden favour for an Alarm, and to be ſenſible of their own ſupplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to project his, which made him ſhortly after ſing, <hi>Fortune my foe,</hi> &amp;c. So that finding his favour declining, and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a receſs, he undertook a new pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrination, to leave that <hi>Terra infirma</hi> of the Court, for that of the Wars, and by declining himſelf, and by abſence, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel his, and the paſſion of his enemies, which in Court was a ſtrange device of ecovery, but that he knew there was
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98923:121"/>ſome ill office done him, that he durſt not attempt to mind any other ways, than by going aſide; thereby to teach envy a new way of forgetfulneſs, and not ſo much as to think of him; howſoever, he had it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in mind, never to forget himſelf; and his device took ſo well, that at his return he came in (as Rams do, by going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) with the greater ſtrength, and ſo continued to her laſt; great in her grace, and Captain of the Guard, where I muſt leave him; but with this obſervation, That though he gained much at the Court, yet he took it not out of the Exchequer, or meerly out of the Queen's purſe, but by his wit, and the help of the Prerogative; for the Queen was never profuſe in the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of her treaſure, but payed many, and moſt of her ſervants part in money, and the reſt with grace, which as the caſe ſtood, was taken for good payment, leaving the Arrear of recompence due to their merit, to her great Succeſſor, who payed them all with advantage.</p>

                  <p>SIR <hi>Foulk Grevil,</hi> ſince Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> had no mean place in her favour, neither did he hold it for any ſhort term, for if I be not deceived, he had the longeſt leaſe, and the ſmootheſt time without rub, of any of her Favourites. He came to the Court in his youth and prime, for that is the time, or never; He was a brave Gentleman, and honourably deſcended, from <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> and Admiral to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh.

                  <p>I find, that he neither ſought for, or obtained any great place or preferment in Court during all the time of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, neither did he need it; for he came thither, backt with a plentiful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which as himſelf was wont to ſay, was the better held together by a ſingle life,

                  <p>MY Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> (as Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> a Gentleman of great parts, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his time and retinue, obſerves) had is introduction by my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> who had married his Mother, a tie of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity; which, beſides a more urgent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, might have invited his care to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him, his Fortune being then (and through his Fathers infelicity) grown low. But that the ſon of a Lord <hi>Ferrers</hi> of <hi>Chartley,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Hartford,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was of the ancient Nobility) and formerly in the Queen's good grace, could not have room in her favour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> was beyond the rule of her nature, which as I have elſewhere taken into obſervation, was ever inclinable to favour the Nobility: Sure it is, That he no ſooner appeared in Court, but he took with the Queen and Courtiers; and I believe, they all could not chooſe but look through the Sacrifice of the Father, on his living Son, whoſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98923:123"/>image by the remembrance of former paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, was afreſh (like the bleeding of men murdered) repreſented to the Court, and offered up as a ſubject of compaſſion to all the Kingdom. There was in this young Lord, together with a moſt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſon, a kind of urbanity or innate courteſie, which both won the Queen, and too much took upon the people, to gaze upon the new adopted Son of her favour.</p>
                  <p>And as I go along, it were not amiſs to take into obſervation two notable quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The firſt was, a violent indulgency of the Queen (which is incident to old age, where it encounters with a pleaſing and ſuitable object) towards this Lord; all which argued a non-perpetuity: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was, a fault in the Object of her grace, my Lord himſelf, who drew in too faſt, like a child ſucking an over uberous Nurſe; and had there been a more decent decorum obſerved in both, or either of thoſe, without doubt the unity of their affections had been more permanent, and not ſo in and out as they were, like an Inſtrument ill tuned, and lapſing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
                  <p>The greater errour of the two (though unwillingly) I am conſtrained to impoſe on my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or rather on his youth; and none of the leaſt of his blame on thoſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98923:123"/>that ſtood Sentinels about him, who might have adviſed him better, but that like men intoxicated with hopes, they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had ſuckt in with the moſt, and of their Lords receipt, and ſo like <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s, would have all or none; A rule quite contrary to nature, and the moſt indulgent Parents, who, though they may expreſs more affection to one in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bequeſts, yet cannot forget ſome Legacies, juſt diſtributives, and divide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ds to others of their begetting: And how hateful partiality proves; every days expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience tells us, out of which common conſideration might have framed to their hands a maxim of more diſcretion for the conduct and management of their now graced Lord and Maſter.</p>
                  <p>But to omit that of Infuſion, and to doe right to truth: My Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> (even of thoſe that truly loved and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him) was noted for too bold an Ingroſſer both of fame and favour; And of this (without offence to the living, or treading on the Sacred Urne of the Dead) I ſhall preſent a Truth, and a paſſage yet in memory.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Mounjoy,</hi> (who was another Child of her favour) being newly come to Court, and then but Sir <hi>Charles Blunt,</hi> (for my Lord <hi>William,</hi> his elder brother, was then living) had the good fortune one day to run
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98923:124"/>very well a Tilt; and the Queen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with was ſo well pleaſed, that ſhe ſent him in Token of her Favour, a Queen at <hi>Cheſſe,</hi> of Gold, Richly Enamelled, which his Servants had the next day faſtned on his Arme with a Crimſon Ribband; which my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as he paſſed through the Privy Chamber, eſpying, with his Cloak caſt under his Arme, the better to commend it to the view, enquired what it was, and for what cauſe there fixed? Sir <hi>Foulk Grevil</hi> told him, That it was the Queen's Favour, which the day before, and after the Tilting, ſhe had ſent him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in a kind of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, and as though he would have limitted her Favour, ſaid, Now I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every Fool muſt have a Favour.</p>
                  <p>This bitter and Publick Affront came to Sir <hi>Charles Blunt</hi>'s eare, who ſent him a Challenge, which was accepted by my Lord, and they met near <hi>Mary-bone-Park,</hi> where my Lord was hurt in the Thigh, and Diſarmed: the Queen miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Men, was very curious to learn the truth; and when at laſt it was whiſpered out, ſhe Swore by God's Death, it was fit that ſome one or other ſhould take him down, and teach him better Manners, otherwiſe there would be no rule with him. And here I
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98923:124"/>note the inition of my Lord's Friendſhip with <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> which the Queen her ſelf did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure.</p>
                  <p>Now for fame, we need not goe far; for my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> having born a grudge to General <hi>Norris,</hi> who had (unwittingly) offered to unpertake the Action of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> with fewer men, than my Lord had before demaned: on his return with Victory, and a glorious report of his valour, he was then thought the onely man for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War; wherein my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſo wrought, by deſpiſing the number, and quality of Rebels, that <hi>Norris</hi> was ſent over with a ſcanted force, joyned with the relicks of the veterance Troops of <hi>Britain,</hi> of ſet purpoſe (as it fell out) to ruine <hi>Norris;</hi> and the Lord <hi>Burrowes,</hi> by my Lord's procurement, ſent at his heels, and to command in chief; and to confine <hi>Norris</hi> only to his Goverment at <hi>Munſter,</hi> which brake the great heart of the General, to ſee himſelf undervalued and underminded by my Lord and <hi>Burrowes,</hi> which was as the Proverb ſpeaks it, <hi>Imber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes docere ſenes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Burrowes,</hi> in the beginning of his proſecution died; whereupon the Queen was fully bent to have ſent over <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> which my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> utterly diſliked, and oppoſed with many reaſons, and by arguments of contempt againſt <hi>Mountjoy,</hi>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:98923:125"/>his then profeſſed friend and familiar; ſo predominant were his words, to reap the honour of cloſing up that War, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Now the way being opened and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own workmanſhip, and ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that none durſt appear to ſtand for the place, at laſt with much adoe he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own ends, and with all his fatal deſtruction, leaving the Queen and the Court (where he ſtood firm and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in her grace) to men that long had ſought and watcht their times to give him the trip, and could never find any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity but this of his abſence, and of his own Creation. And theſe are the true obſervations of his appetite and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were not of any true proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but carried and tranſported with an over-deſire and thirſtineſs after fame, and that deceitfull fame of popularity. And to help on his Cataſtrophe, I obſerve like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe two ſorts of people that had a hand in his fall; the firſt was the Souldiery, which all flockt unto him, as foretelling a mortality; and are commonly of blunt and too rough Counſels, and many times diſſonant from the time of the Court and the State. The other ſort were of his family, his ſervants, and his own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſuch as were bound by the rules of ſafety, and obligations of fidelity, to have
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98923:125"/>looked better to the ſteering of that Boat, wherein they themſelves were carried, and not have ſuffered it to float and run on ground, with thoſe empty Sails of Fame and Tumour of popular applauſe. Me thinks one honeſt man or other, that had but the office of bruſhing his clothes, might have whiſpered in his ear, My Lord, look to it, this multitude that follows you, will either devour you, or undoe you; ſtrive not to rule, and over rule all, for it will coſt hot water, and it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure envy; and if needs your. Genius muſt have it ſo, let the Court, and the Queens preſence be your ſtation. But as I have ſaid, they had ſuckt too much of their Lord's milk, and inſtead of withdrawing, they blew the coals of his ambition, and infuſed into him too much of the ſpirit of glory; yea, and mixed the goodneſs of his nature with a touch of revenge, which is ever accompanied with a deſtiny of the ſame fate. And of this number there were ſome inſufferable Natures about him, that towards his laſt gave deſperate advice, ſuch as his integrity abhorred, and his fidelity forbade; Amongſt whom, Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> notes (without injury) his Secretary <hi>Cuffe</hi> a vile man, and of a perverſe nature: I could alſo name others, that when he was in the right courſe of recovery, and ſetling to modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98923:126"/>would not ſuffer a receſs in him, but ſtirred up the dregs of thoſe rude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which by time, and his affliction, out of his own judgment he ſought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; or to give them all a vomit. And thus I conclude this Noble Lord, as a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between proſperity and adverſity; once the Child of his great Miſtreſſes favour, but the Son of <hi>Bellona.</hi>

                  <p>MY Lord of <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> was of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe of the <hi>Sackvils,</hi> and of the Queens conſanguinity; his Father was Sir <hi>Richard Sackvil,</hi> or as the people then called him, Fill ſack, by reaſon of his gaeat wealth, and the vaſt patrimony which he left to his Son; whereof he ſpent in his youth the beſt part, untill the Queen by her frequent admonitions diverted the torrent of his profuſion. He was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine Gentleman of perſon and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both of art and nature; but without meaſure magnificent, till on the turn of his
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98923:126"/>humour, and the allay that his years and good counſels had wrought upon thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate courſes of his youth, and that height of ſpirit inherent to his Houſe. And then did the Queen, as a moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and indulgent Prince, when ſhe ſaw the man grow ſtayed and ſetled, give him her aſſiſtance, and advanced him to the Treaſurſhip, where he made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to his Houſe for his miſ-ſpent time, both in the increaſement of Eſtate and Honour, which the Queen conferred on him, together with the opportunity to remake himſelf, and thereby to ſhew that this was a Child, that ſhould have a ſhare in her grace, and a taſte of her bounty.</p>
                  <p>They much commend his Elocution, but more the excellency of his Pen, for he was a Schollar, and a perſon of a quick diſpatch, (Faculties that yet run in the bloud.) And they ſay of him, that his Secretaries did little for him by the way of Inditement, wherein they could ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom pleaſe him, he was ſo facete and choice in his Phraſe and Stile: And for his Diſpatches, and the content he gave to Suiters, he had a Decorum ſeldom ſince put in practiſe; for he had of his Attendants that took into Roll the names of all Suiters, which the Date of their firſt
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98923:127"/>Addreſſes; and theſe in their Order had hearing; ſo that a freſh man could not leap over his head, that was of a more ancient edition except in the urgent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State.</p>
                  <p>I find not, that he was any ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhared in the factions of the Court, which were all his times ſtrong, and in every mans note; The <hi>Howards</hi> and the <hi>Cecils</hi> on the one part, My Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> &amp;c. on the other part. For he held the ſtaff of the Treaſury faſt in his hand, which once in the year made them all behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. And the truth is, (as he was a wiſe man, and a ſtout) he had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be a partaker; for he ſtood ſure in bloud, and in grace, and was wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the Queens ſervice; and ſuch were his abilities, that ſhe received aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous proofs of his ſufficiency; and it hath been thought, that ſhe might have had more cunning inſtruments, but none of a more ſtrong judgment and confidence in his ways, which are ſymptoms of magnanimity and fidelity; whereunto me thinks this Motto hath ſome kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>Aut nunquam tentes, aut perfice,</hi> As though he would have charactered in a word the Genius of his Houſe, or expreſt ſomewhat of an higher inclination, than lay within his compaſs.

                  <p>As he came from <hi>Oxford,</hi> he took the <hi>Inner-Temple</hi> in his way to Court; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he no ſooner came, but (without asking) he had a pretty ſtrange kind of admiſſion, which I have heard from a diſcreet man of his own, and much more of the ſecrets of thoſe times. He was then much about twenty years of age, of a brown hair, a ſweet face, a moſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98923:128"/>neat Compoſure, and tall in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Queen was then at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and at dinner, whither he came to ſee the faſhion of the Court: the Queen had ſoon found him out, and with a kind of an affected frown, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lady-Carver, What he was? ſhe anſwered, She knew him not; Inſomuch as enquiry was made from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who he might be; till at length it was told the Queen, he was Brother to the Lord <hi>William Mountjoy.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, with the eye of Majeſty fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, (as ſhe was wont to doe, and to daunt men ſhe knew not) ſtirred the bloud of this young Gentleman, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, as his colour came and went; which the Queen obſerving, called him unto her, and gave him her hand to kiſs, encouraging him with gravious words, and new looks; and ſo divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſpeech to the Lords and Ladies, ſhe ſaid, That ſhe no ſooner obſerved him, but that ſhe knew there was in him ſome Noble bloud, with ſome other expreſſions of pitty towards his houſe: And then again demanding his name, ſhe ſaid, Fail you not to come to the Court, and I will bethink my ſelf how to doe you good. And this was his inlet, and the beginnings of his grace. Where
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98923:128"/>it falls into conſideration, That though he wanted not Wit and Courage, (for he had very fine Attractions, and being a good piece of a Schollar) yet were they accompanied with the retractiveneſs of baſhfulneſs, and a natural Modeſty, which (as the Tone of his Houſe, and the Ebbe of his Fortune then ſtood) might have hindred his Progreſſion, had they not been re-inforced by the infuſion of Soveraign Favour, and the Queen's Gracious Invitation. And that it may appear how low he was, and how much that Heretick Neceſſity will work in the dejection of good ſpirits, I can deliver it with aſſurance, that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition was very ſcant until his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died, which was ſhortly after his admiſſion to the Court, and then was was it no more than 1000 Marks <hi>per Annum,</hi> wherewith he lived plentifully in a fine way and garb, and without any great Suſtentation, during all her Times. And as there was in his nature a kind of backwardneſs, which did not befriend him, nor ſuit with the motion of the Court, ſo there was in him an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Armes, and a humour of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling: which, had not ſome wiſe Men about him laboured to remove, and the Queen her ſelf laid in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he would (out of his natural
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98923:129"/>propenſion) have marred his own mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: For as he was grown by reading, (whereunto he was much addicted) to the Theory of a Souldier, ſo was he ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invited by his Genius to the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Practick of the War; which were the cauſes of his excurſions; for he had a Company in the Low-Countries, from whence he came over with a Noble accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Queen; but ſomewhat reſtleſs in honourable thoughts, he expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again and again, and would preſs the Queen with the pretences of viſiting his Company ſo often, that at length he had a flat denial; and yet he ſtole over with Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> into the Action of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> (which was then a hot and active War) whom he would always call his Father, honouring him above all men, and ever bewailing his end: ſo contrary he was in his eſteem and valuation of this great Commander, to that of his Friend, my Lord of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> Till at laſt, the Queen began to take his Deceſſions for Contempts, and confined his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Court, and her own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: And upon my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s fall, (ſo confident ſhe was in her own Princely judgment, and opinion ſhe had conceived of his worth and conduct) that ſhe would have this Noble Gentleman, and none other, to finiſh and bring the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:98923:129"/>War to a propitious end: For it was a prophetical Speech of her own, That it would be his fortune, and his honour, to cut the thred of that fatal Rebellion, and to bring her in peace to the Grave. Where ſhe was not deceived; for he atchieved it, but with much pains and carefulneſs, and not without the fears and many jealouſies of the Court and Times, wherewith the Queen's age, and the malignity of her ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting times were replete.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I come to his dear Friend in Court, Maſter Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> whom, in his long abſence from Court he adored as his Saint, and courted for his onely <hi>Maece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> both before and after his departure from Court, and during all the time of his Command in <hi>Ireland,</hi> well knowing that it lay in his power, and by a word of his mouth, to make or marr him.</p>

                  <head>Cecil.</head>
                  <p>SIR <hi>Robert Cecil,</hi> ſince Earl of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> was the Son of the Lord <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> and the Inheritor of his Wiſdom, and, by degrees, Succeſſor of his Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Favours, though not of his Lands; for he had Sir <hi>Thomas Cecil,</hi> his Elder Brother, ſince Created Earl of <hi>Exeter.</hi> He was firſt Secretary of State, then Maſter of the Wards, and in the laſt of her Raign came to be Lord Treaſurer; all which were the ſteps of his Father's greatneſs, and of the Honour he left to his Houſe. For his perſon, he was not much beholding to Nature, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for his Face, which was the beſt part of his outſide: but for his inſide, it may be ſaid, and without ſoloeciſme, that he was his Father's own Son, and a pregnant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in all Diſcipline of State: He was a Courtier from his Cradle, (which might
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98923:130"/>have made him betimes) yet at the Age of Twenty and upwards, he was much ſhort of his after-proof; but expoſed, and by change of Climate, he ſoon made ſhew what he was, and would be: He lived in thoſe times wherein the Queen had moſt need, and uſe of Men of Weight; and amongſt able ones, this was a Chief, as having his ſufficiency from his Inſtructions that Begat him, the Tutorſhip of the Times, and Court, which were then the Academies of Art and Cunning; for ſuch was the Queen's condition from the Tenth or Twelfth of her Raign, that ſhe had the happineſs to ſtand up (whereof there is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intimation) though invironed with more Enemies, and aſſaulted with more dangerous Practiſes, than any Prince of her Times, and of many Ages before. Neither muſt we, in this her Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, attribute too much to Humane Policies: for that God in his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Providence, had not onely ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Secondary Meanes, as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Work, but by an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Manifeſtation, that the ſame Work which ſhe acted, was a Well-pleaſing Service of his own, out of a peculiar care had decreed the Protection of the Work-Miſtriſs, and thereunto added
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:98923:131"/>his abundant bleſſing upon all, and whatſoever ſhe undertook; which is an obſervation of ſatisfaction to my ſelf, that ſhe was in the right; though to others now breathing under the ſame form, and frame of her Government, it may not ſeem an Animadverſion of any worth: but I leave them to the peril of their own folly.</p>
                  <p>And ſo again to this great Maſter of State, and the Staff of the Queen's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Age; who, though his little crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſon could not promiſe any great ſupportation, yet it carried thereon a Head, and a Head-piece of a vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and therein it ſeems Nature was ſo diligent to compleat one, and the beſt part about him, as that to the perfection of his Memory, and Intellectuals, ſhe took care alſo of his Sences, and to put him in <hi>Linceos Oculos,</hi> or to pleaſure him the more, borrowed of <hi>Argus,</hi> ſo to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a proſpective ſight; and for the reſt of his ſenſitive vertues, his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor <hi>Walſingham</hi> had left him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, to ſmell out what was done in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave; and his good old Father was ſo well ſeen in the Mathermaticks, as that he could tell you through all <hi>Spain,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, every Ship, with the Burthens, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound with preparation, what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98923:131"/>for diverſion of Enterpriſes, Counſels, and Reſolutions. And, that we may ſee (as in a little Map) how docible this little man was: I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a taſte of his Abilities.</p>
                  <p>My Lord of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> (upon the certainty the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would invade <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with a ſtrong Army) had written very earneſtly to the Queen and the Council, for ſuch Supplies to be ſent over, that might enable him to march up to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> if he did Land, and follow on his proſecution againſt the Rebels. Sir <hi>Robert Cecil,</hi> (beſides the general diſpatch of the Council, as he often did) Wrote this in private; for theſe two began then to Love dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

                  <p>And ſo I ſhall only vindicate the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of his death, and conclude him.

                  <p>SIR <hi>Francis Vere</hi> was of the ancient and of the moſt Noble extract of the Earls of <hi>Oxford:</hi> And it may be a queſtion, whether the Nobility of his Houſe, or the Honour of his Atchievements might moſt commend him; but that we have an authentick Rule to decide the doubt:
<q>
                        <l>Nam genus &amp; proavos, &amp; quae non fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus ipſi,</l>

                     </q> For though he were an Honourable Slip of that ancient Tree of Nobility, (which was no diſadvantage to his vertue) yet he brought more glory to the Name of <hi>Vere</hi> than he took of Bloud from the Family. He was amongſt the Queens Sword-men inferiour to none, but ſuperior to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98923:133"/>Of whom it may be ſaid, To ſpeak much of him, were the way to leave out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might add to his praiſe, and to forget more that could add to his Honour.</p>
                  <p>I find not that he came much to the Court, for he lived almoſt perpetually in the Camp: but when he did, no Man had more of the Queen's Favour, and none leſs envyed; for he ſeldom troubled it with the jealouſie and alarms of ſupplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; his way was another ſort of undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. They report, that the Queen (as ſhe loved Martial Men) would Court this Gentleman, as ſoon as he appeared in her Preſence. And ſurely he was a Souldier of great worth, and Commanded Thirty years in the Service of the States, and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Chief, as the Queen's General: and he that had ſeen the Battel of <hi>Newport,</hi> might there beſt have taken him, and his Noble Brother my Lord of <hi>Tilbury,</hi> to the Life.</p>

                  <p>MY Lord of <hi>Worceſter</hi> I have here put laſt, but not leaſt in the Queen's Favour. He was of the ancient and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blood of the <hi>Bewfords,</hi> and of her Grandfather's Line by the Mother; which the Queen could never forget; eſpecially where there was a concurrency of old blood with fidelity, a mixture which ever ſorted with the Queen's Nature. And though there might appear ſomething in this Houſe which might avert her Grace, (though not to ſpeak of my Lord himſelf, but with due reverence and Honour) I mean contrariety or ſuſpicion in Religion; yet the Queen ever reſpected this Houſe, and principally this Noble Lord, whom ſhe firſt made Maſter of the Horſe, and then admitted of her Council of State. In his youth (part whereof he ſpent before he came to reſide at Court) he was a very
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98923:134"/>fine Gentleman, and the beſt Horſeman and Tilter of the Times, which were then the Manlike and Noble Recreations of the Court, and ſuch as took up the Applauſe of Men, as well as the Praiſe and Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Ladies. And when years had abated theſe Exerciſes of Honour, he grew then to be a faithful and profound Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor. And as I have placed him laſt, ſo was he the laſt Liver of all the Servants of her Favour, and had the honour to ſee his Renowned Miſtriſs, and all of them laid in the places of their Reſt: And for himſelf, after a Life of a very Noble and Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reputation, he died Rich, and in a Peaceable Old Age. A fate, (that I make the laſt, and none of the ſlighteſt Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations) which befel not many of the reſt; for they expired like unto Lights blown out, with the Snuff ſtinking, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably extinguiſhed, and with Offence to the ſtanders by.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I delivered up this my poor Eſſay; A little Draught of this great Princeſs, and her Times, with the Servants of her State and Favour. I cannot ſay, I have finiſhed it; for I know how defective and imperfect it is, as limbed onely in the original nature, not without the active ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98923:135"/>and ſo left it as a task fitter for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote times, and the ſallies of ſome bolder Pencil to correct that which is amiſs, and draw the reſt up to life. As for me to have endeavoured it, I took it to conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, how eaſily I might have daſht in too much of the ſtrain of pollution, and thereby have defaced that little which is done: For I profeſs, I have taken care ſo to maſter my Pen, that I might not (<hi>ex a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo,</hi> or of ſet-purpoſe) diſcolour truth, or any of the parts thereof, otherwiſe than in concealment. Happily there are ſome which will not approve of this modeſty, but will cenſure me for puſillanimity, and, with great cunning Artiſts attempt to draw their Line further out at large, and, upon this of mine; which may with ſomewhat more eaſe be effected, for that the frame is ready made to their hands; and then happily I could draw one in the midſt of theirs. But that modeſty in me forbids the defacements of Men departed, whoſe Poſterity yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, enjoys the merit of their vertues, and do ſtill live in their Honour. And I had rather incurr the cenſure of abruption, than to be conſcious, and taken in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eruption, and of trampling upon the Graves of Perſons at reſt; which living,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98923:135"/>we durſt not look in the face, nor make our Addreſſes to them, otherwiſe than with due regard to their Honours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown to their Vertues.</p>
